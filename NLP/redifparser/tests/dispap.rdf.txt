Abstract: Norway. The new system fulfils several criteria for a defined
	contribution scheme. Earnings from all years in work count in the
	accumulation of entitlements, and an actuarial rule converting the
	final balance into an annuity is introduced. But the pension system
	will still be a part of the general public finances and therefore
	financed pay-as-you-go. And before taking adjustments for
	increasing life expectancy into account, the level of old age
	pension benefits is calibrated to the former defined benefit
	system. The paper shows that given these restrictions it is of
	minor importance if the new pension system is described as defined
	benefit versus defined contribution. One modification follows from
	the treatment of inheritance of entitlements from persons who die
	before the lower age limit of retirement. The discussion is
	illustrated empirically by using Statistics Norway’s dynamic
	microsimulation model MOSART.

Classification-JEL: E1; E32; E44
Abstract: This paper gives a brief description and studies the salient
	features of a core macro-econometric model that allows for
	self-reinforcing co-movements between credit, asset prices and real
	economic activity, often denominated a financial accelerator in the
	literature. In contrast to the economic literature that cultivates
	highly stylized model representations aimed at illustrating the
	working and the implications of such a feature, the model of this
	paper integrates no less than two mutually reinforcing financial
	accelerator mechanisms in a full-fledged core macroeconomic model
	framework. Noteworthy, the impulse response pattern overall of such
	a model turns out to be very much in line with the ones one would
	have expected using a SVAR/DSGE modelling framework, though the
	amplitude of shocks is in most cases stronger than the ones
	pertaining to these kind of models. This is due to the working of
	the financial accelerators that contribute to magnify the effects
	of shocks to the economy. Furthermore, a forecast comparison
	undertaken between our model and an alternative macro econometric
	model not furnished with a financial block, suggests that financial
	feedback mechanisms have got the potential of boosting the
	forecasting property of theory-informed macro econometric models.
	Hence, in addition to enhancing the practical relevance of a model
	by incorporating a mechanism of high real-world authenticity,
	financial accelerators seem to come with a couple of values added.
	Namely, to i) guarantee against a systematic underestimation of the
	effects of macroeconomic shocks and to ii) be forecast-promoting

Classification-JEL: C23; C81; J31
Abstract: A model for matched data with two types of unobserved
	heterogeneity is considered – one related to the observation unit,
	the other to units to which the observation units are matched. One
	or both of the unobserved components are assumed to be random.
	Applying the Helmert transformation to reduce dimensionality
	simplifies the computational problem substantially. The framework
	has many potential applications; we apply it to wage modeling.
	Traditionally, unobserved individual and firm heterogeneity in wage
	equations have been represented by fixed effects. However, because
	of the presence of time-invariant covariates, we argue that
	specifications with random effects also deserve some attention. Our
	mixed model allows identification of the effects of time invariant
	variables on wages, such as for instance education. Using Norwegian
	manufacturing data it turns out that the assumption with respect to
	firm-specific unobserved heterogeneity affects the estimate of the
	return to education considerably.

Abstract: This paper uses a unique data set with nearly career-long

	the importance of life-cycle bias in earnings regressions using
	current earnings as a proxy for lifetime earnings. To account for
	the endogeneity of schooling, we apply three commonly used
	identification strategies. Our estimates demonstrate a strong
	life-cycle bias, often exceeding the bias from assuming that
	schooling is exogenous. We further explore the problems caused by
	life-cycle bias in research on the economic returns to schooling,
	and discuss possible remedies.

Abstract: We use a dynamic factor model and a detailed panel data set with
	quarterly accounts data on all Norwegian banks to study the effects
	of banks' funding costs on their retail rates. Banks' funds are
	categorized into two groups: customer deposits and long-term
	wholesale funding (market funding from private and institutional
	investors including other banks). The cost of market funding is
	represented in the model by the three-month Norwegian Inter Bank
	Offered Rate (NIBOR) and the spread of unsecured senior bonds
	issued by Norwegian banks. Our estimates show clear evidence of
	incomplete pass-through: a unit increase in NIBOR leads to an
	approximately 0.8 increase in bank rates. On the other hand, the
	difference between banks' loan and deposit rates is independent of
	NIBOR. Our findings are consistent with the view that banks face a
	downward-sloping demand curve for loans and an upward-sloping
	supply curve for customer deposits.

Abstract: Given the bleak prospects for a global agreement on mitigating
	climate change, pressure for unilateral abatement is increasing. A
	major challenge is emissions leakage. Border carbon adjustments and
	output-based allocation of emissions allowances can increase
	effectiveness of unilateral action but introduce distortions of
	their own. We assess antileakage measures as a function of
	abatement coalition size. We first develop a partial equilibrium
	analytical framework to see how these instruments affect emissions
	within and outside the coalition. We then employ a computable
	general equilibrium model of international trade and energy use to
	assess the strategies as the coalition grows. We find that full
	border adjustments rank first in global cost-effectiveness,
	followed by import tariffs and output-based rebates. The
	differences across measures and their overall appeal decline as the
	abatement coalition grows. In terms of cost, the coalition
	countries prefer border carbon adjustments; countries outside the
	coalition prefer output-based rebates.

Abstract: We analyze how different ways of allocating emission quotas may
	influence the electricity market. Using a large-scale numerical
	model of the Western European energy market, we show that different
	allocation mechanisms can have very different effects on the
	electricity market, even if the total emission target is fixed.
	This is particularly the case if output-based allocation (OBA) of
	quotas is used, with gas power production substantially higher,
	partly at the expense of renewable and coal power, than if
	grandfathering and auctioning based mechanisms are used. The price
	of emissions is almost twice as high. Moreover, even though
	electricity prices are lower, the welfare costs of attaining a
	fixed emission target are significantly higher. The paper analyzes
	other allocation mechanisms as well, leading to yet more outcomes
	in the electricity market. The numerical results for OBA are
	supported by theoretical analysis, with some new general results.

Classification-JEL: J12; J13
Abstract: In spite of more symmetric parental roles in couples, shared
	residence is still practiced by a minority of parents following
	partnership dissolution in Norway, and the same is true for father
	sole custody. Utilising a survey of parents living apart in 2004,
	we find that shared residence is particularly likely when the
	father has a medium or high income, the mother is highly educated,
	the parents split up rather recently, the mother is currently
	married and the parents have no other children in their present
	households. Father sole custody is most likely when the mother has
	low income, the father has high income, the parents were formally
	married prior to the breakup, the child is a boy, the child is
	fairly old, the father is single and the mother has children in her
	current household. More equal parenting roles in couples in younger
	generations as well as policies urging parents to collaborate about
	their children’s upbringing when they split up, may lead to an
	increase in shared residence in the years to come, and perhaps also
	to new groups of parents practicing such an arrangement.

Keywords: Housewife; gender; equality; labour market; unpaid work.

Abstract: The number of housewives has declined significantly in most

	homemaker role in the media and public discourse. Utilising
	representative survey data from 2007 we examine the prevalence and
	characteristics of the housewife role in present Norway, a
	social-democratic country with high gender-equality ambitions.
	Irrespective of the definition used, being a housewife is clearly a
	minority practice in Norway. About one out of ten partnered women
	of prime working age either look upon themselves as housewives or
	work for pay less than 20 hours per week. Housewives are
	overrepresented among the less educated, those with health
	restrictions, women with many children and young children,
	non-Western immigrants and those with a partner with fairly high
	income. The partners’ aggregate income is lower in housewife
	couples than in other couples, though. Housewives are usually in
	charge of most domestic chores and report high levels of
	satisfaction with their division of labour and domestic economy.
	The analysis does not support the popular notion that today’s
	housewife is primarily a highly educated woman who puts her career
	on halt, or a rich man’s wife who spends her time on leisure
	activities.

Classification-JEL: J21; J22; J24; J13; J16
Abstract: Considering the high female part-time rates in Norway, one may
	envisage a sizeable additional labour supply if more part-time
	working women would switch to full time. In view of an ageing
	population and increased demand for labour in the future, we
	investigate this issue by studying married and cohabiting women’s
	transitions from part-time to full-time work based on panel data
	from 2003-2009. Contrary to evidence from other countries with
	well-established support for working mothers, we find that young
	children in the household still restrain Norwegian women’s mobility
	to full-time work. On the other hand, there is a strong trend of
	higher full-time transition rates over our study period, which may
	reflect a vast expansion of the day care sector with more and
	cheaper day care, as well as a booming economy. Part timers who
	work in typical female occupations such as nursing, and sales and
	services are also less likely to switch to full time. Whether this
	is a result of true preferences or constraints is difficult to say,
	but previous research suggest that involuntary part time may be
	substantial. Voluntariness may further be a matter of degree, and
	“chosen” part timers may also switch to full time if conditions
	were right.

	evidence that fathers' earnings and work hours are affected by
	paternity leave. Contrary to expectation, mothers' labor market
	outcomes are adversely affected by paternity leave. Our findings do
	therefore not suggest that paternity leave shifts the gender
	balance at home in a way that increases mothers' time and/or effort

Keywords: Aggregation; index numbers; international prices; the China
	effect
Classification-JEL: C43; E31
Abstract: Aggregation of international prices in empirical work is
	generally based on well known index number formulas. However, a
	common practice applying such formulas is the use of price indices
	rather than price levels for which data across countries are rarely
	available. Numerical calculations of price aggregates are therefore
	typically not able to fully capture the increasingly important role
	that low-cost countries play in determining international prices.
	When only price indices for a tradable group of interest are
	available the question arises of how to approximate relative price
	levels across countries to accommodate inflationary impulses and
	price level differences in a final index number. In the present
	note, we address this question from both a theoretical and an
	empirical perspective. We propose a conceptual framework for
	analysing sources of change in international prices using the
	Törnqvist price index as the underlying index number formula.
	Herein, we suggest a calibration method based on purchasing power
	parities to make a relative price index interpretable as a relative
	price level. We present an illustrative numerical example based on
	data from the industry of textiles and wearing apparel. Our
	findings show that the impact of price level differences (the
	so-called China effect) is substantial in the computed aggregate of
	international prices.

Abstract: We consider an international emissions trading scheme with

	expansion of the trading scheme is beneficial in aggregate, but not
	necessarily for individual countries. We simulate international CO2
	emission quota markets using marginal abatement cost functions and
	the Copenhagen 2020 climate policy targets for selected countries
	that strategically allocate emissions in a bid to manipulate the
	quota price. Quota exporters and importers generally have
	conflicting interests about admitting more countries to the trading
	coalition, and our results indicate that some countries may lose
	substantially when the coalition expands in terms of new countries.
	For a given coalition, expanding sectoral coverage makes most
	countries better off, but some countries (notably the USA and
	Russia) may lose out due to loss of strategic advantages. In
	general, exporters tend to have stronger strategic power than
	importers.

Abstract: This paper analyzes male fertility, focusing especially on

	that socioeconomic disadvantaged men have the lowest chance of
	becoming fathers, and also the lowest likelihood of having more
	children in stable unions. Multi-partner fertility, on the other
	hand, is positively associated with both disadvantage and
	advantage, as higher-order birth-risks with a new partner are more
	prevalent among men with low as well as high socio-economic status.
	An intervening factor among the former may be more unstable unions
	and higher dissolution risks, while the elevated risk among the
	latter may be associated with their higher prefrerences for
	children as well as features that make these men more attractive as
	partners and fathers of future children.

	short run. The long run dependence is analyzed within a
	cointegrated vector autoregression in real housing prices, real
	disposable household income and real household debt, conditioning
	on the real after tax interest rate, the number of house
	transactions and the volume of housing capital. We identify two
	cointegrating equations which determine equilibrium housing prices
	and household debt, respectively. The long run equations are
	embedded in a system of two error-correction equations which is
	estimated simultaneously. The model yields meaningful short and
	long term effects when estimated on the sample 1986q2-2008q4 and
	impulse responses demonstrate that there are self reinforcing
	feedback effects between the two variables of interest.

Abstract: Using data on individuals born 1946 to 1972 from the Norwegian
	Generations and Gender Survey (N = 7,587) we examine differentials
	in the number and incidence of co-residential relationships by
	gender and socioeconomic status. Regarding number of relationships,
	we found that women and younger respondents more often than men and
	older respondents reported having had two or more unions. 10% of
	the men and 5% of the women had no union experience by age 35.
	Controlling for relevant characteristics, our multivariate results
	showed that high income men experienced fewer unions than lower
	income men. Having a low income increased the odds of remaining
	single among men, whereas there was a positive association between
	tertiary education and remaining unpartnered among women.

Classification-JEL: H11; H23; H53
Abstract: Empirical findings on the relationship between income inequality
	and redistribution from a cross-country perspective are not
	conclusive. One reason may be that observers have in mind different
	concepts of redistribution. A major factor is that comparator
	countries’ pre-fisc distributions typically differ markedly, and
	account is taken of this differently (if at all) by different
	measures of redistribution. The ambiguities can be resolved by
	applying the “transplant-and-compare” approach, rendering fiscal
	regimes into a common base by adjusting for differences in pre-fisc
	income inequality, and then measuring the “pure” effect of
	tax-and-transfer policies using this benchmark. We illustrate both
	what is possible, and what remains problematic, using this
	technique, by conducting an exploratory international comparison,
	based on microdata from the Luxembourg Income Study database in
	combination with more aggregated information from the OECD, for 15
	countries.

	terms of a “common base” approach, which means that a benchmark is
	established to identify how the “redistributional efforts” of

	evaluation of the 2006 Norwegian tax reform, the results suggest

Classification-JEL: D31; D63; H31
Abstract: Tax systems with separate taxation of wage and capital income,
	also called dual income tax systems, have gained relevance through
	the Mirrlees Review. Obviously, such tax systems are exposed to
	horizontal equity (HE) failures, or horizontal inequity (HI). HE
	and HI have a firm grip on assessment of fair tax policies, both
	from an academic point of view and in general public debate. The
	dual income tax system of Norway was modified by the tax reform of
	2006 precisely because the previous schedule failed to deliver
	equal tax treatment of equals. This paper discusses the meaning and
	measurement of HI effects of dual income tax systems, and evaluates
	the development of HI for Norway over the time period 2000–2008
	using micro data. A copula-based identification strategy
	efficiently establishes a framework for evaluations of HI over
	time. The dual income tax system and the early announcement of its
	impending revision during the period under examination created
	measurement problems which we had to account for by defining a new
	income concept for the empirical strategy. As expected, we find
	less HI in Norway after the reform of 2006.

Abstract: The interaction between financial markets and the macroeconomy
	can be strongly affected by changes in credit market regulations.
	In order to take account of these effects we control explicitly for
	regime shifts in a system of debt equations for Norway using a
	common, flexible trend. The estimated shape of the trend matches
	the qualitative development in the regulations, and we argue that
	it can be viewed as a measure of relative credit availability, or
	credit conditions, for the period 1975-2008 -- a credit conditions
	index (CCI). This entails years of strict credit market regulations
	in the 1970s, its gradual deregulation in the 1980s, followed by a
	full-blown banking crisis in the years around 1990 and the
	development thereafter up to the advent of the current financial
	crisis. Our study is inspired by Fernandez-Corugedo and Muellbauer
	(2006), which introduced the methodology and provided estimates of
	a CCI for the UK. The trend conditions on a priori knowledge about
	changes in the Norwegian regulatory system, as documented in Krogh
	(2010b), and it shows robustness when estimated recursively.

Keywords: Arctic; oil market; gas market; equilibrium model
Classification-JEL: Q31; Q41; R10
Abstract: The Arctic has a substantial share of global petroleum resources,
	but at higher costs than in most other petroleum provinces. Arctic
	states and petroleum companies are carefully considering the
	potential for future extraction in the Arctic. This paper studies
	the oil and gas supply from 6 arctic regions during 2010-2050 along
	with global economic growth and different assumptions regarding
	petroleum prices and resource endowments. Supply is calculated
	based on a global model of oil and gas markets. The data on
	undiscovered resources for the Arctic is based on the estimates by
	USGS. Sensitivity studies are carried out for two alternative price
	scenarios and for a 50 per cent reduction of arctic undiscovered
	resources compared with the USGS 2008 resource estimate. Although a
	major part of the undiscovered arctic petroleum resources is
	natural gas, our results show that the relative importance of the
	Arctic as a world gas supplier will decline, while its importance
	as a global oil producer may be maintained. We also show that less
	than full access to undiscovered oil resources will have minor
	effect on total arctic oil production and a marginal effect on
	arctic gas extraction. The reason is that Arctic Russia is an
	important petroleum producer with a sufficiently large stock of
	already discovered resources to support their petroleum production
	before 2050.

Keywords: Emissions trading; allocation of quotas; abatement technology.
Classification-JEL: H21; Q58
Abstract: Allocation of emission allowances may affect firms' incentives to
	invest in clean technologies. In this paper we show that so-called
	output-based allocation tends to stimulate such investments as long
	as individual firms do not assume the regulator to tighten the
	allocation rule as a consequence of their investments. The
	explanation is that output-based allocation creates an implicit
	subsidy to the firms' output, which increases production, leads to
	a higher price of allowances, and thus increases the incentives to
	invest in clean technologies. On the other hand, if the firms
	expect the regulator to tighten the allocation rule after observing
	their clean technology investment, the firms' incentives to invest
	are moderated. If strong, this last effect may outweigh the
	enhanced investment incentives induced by increased output and
	higher allowance price.

Classification-JEL: H23; Q55; Q58. 
Abstract: This paper shows that tradable emissions permits and an emissions
	tax have a risk-related technology choice effect. We first examine
	the first- and second-order moments in the probability
	distributions of optimal abatement and production under the two
	instruments. The two instruments will, in general, lead to
	different expected aggregate production levels when technology
	choice is endogenous, given that regulation is designed to induce
	equal expected aggregate emissions. Moreover, either regulatory
	approach may induce larger variance in optimal production and
	optimal abatement levels, depending on the specification of the
	stochastic variables. Finally, because firms’ valuation of a
	flexible technology increases if the variance in abatement is
	inflated and vice versa, either of the two instruments may induce
	the most flexible technology. Specifically, a tax encourages the
	most flexibility if and only if abatement costs and the equilibrium
	permit price have sufficiently strong positive covariance compared
	with the variance in the price on the good produced.

Classification-JEL: J21; J22; J64
Abstract: This paper analyzes labor force participation with particular
	reference to the discouraged worker effect. Discouraged workers are
	those who do not search for work because they view their chances of
	finding a suitable job as too low. The theoretical point of
	departure is a search model where the worker evaluates the expected
	utility of searching for work and decides to participate in the
	labor market if the expected utility of the search exceeds the
	utility of not working. From this framework we derive an empirical
	model for the probability that the worker will be unemployed or
	employed as a function of the probability of getting an acceptable
	job, given that the worker searches for work. The model is
	estimated on a sample of married and cohabitating women in Norway
	covering the period from 1988 to 2008. The results show that the
	discouraged worker effect is substantial. On average, about one
	third of those who are out of the labor force are discouraged
	according to our analysis.

Classification-JEL: H25; O38
Abstract: We find that the Norwegian R&D tax credit scheme introduced in
	2002 mainly works as intended. The scheme is cost-effective and it
	is used by a large number of firms. It stimulates these firms to
	invest more in R&D, and, in particular, the effect is positive for
	small firms with little R&D experience. The returns on the R&D
	investments supported by the scheme are positive and generally not
	different from the returns to other R&D investments. We have found
	examples of what can be interpreted as tax motivated adjustments to
	the scheme, but to some extent this must be accepted as a cost to
	subsidy and support schemes intended for use by a large number of
	economic agents. This is particularly so when attempts are made to
	keep administrative expenditures and control routines at a low
	level.

Abstract: Owing to the extensive critique of food-crop-based biofuels,

	account, it becomes necessary to reconsider the potential
	mitigation effects of the increased use of wood fuels from boreal
	forests. This paper finds that the increased harvest of a boreal

Abstract: An important aim of Norwegian work-family policies is to promote
	a dual-earner, equal-sharing family model, but we do not really
	know how common this family type is. By means of a multinomial
	latent-class model we develop a typology of dual-earner couples
	with children based on the way the partners allocate paid and
	unpaid work between them. We estimate four classes. One fourth of
	the couples belong to the Neo-Traditional class, where the mother
	often works part time and shoulders the domestic duties, whereas
	the father works full time or long hours. The Gender-Equal Light
	type, which comprises one third of the couples, has a similar, but
	less extreme gender disparity of paid and unpaid duties. In the
	both the Generalized Gender-Equal type (23 percent) and the
	Specialized Gender-Equal type (18 percent) the partners share paid
	and unpaid work fairly equally between them, but the spouses
	specialize more in different family tasks in the latter than in the
	former type. An equal sharing of paid and unpaid work is most
	likely when the partners are well educated, both partners work
	regular hours and the father has public-sector employment. A
	neo-traditional practice is likely when the partners have less
	education, the mother has health problems, the father works in the
	private sector, and the partners work non-regular hours.

Abstract: Individual countries are in the process of legislating responses
	to the challenges posed by climate change. The prospect of rising
	carbon prices raises concerns in these nations about the effects on
	the competitiveness of their own energy-intensive industries and
	the potential for carbon leakage, particularly leakage to emerging
	economies that lack comparable regulation. In response, certain
	developed countries are proposing controversial trade-related
	measures and allowance allocation designs to complement their
	climate policies. Missing from much of the debate on trade-related
	measures is a broader understanding of how climate policies
	implemented unilaterally (or subglobally) affect all countries in
	the global trading system. Arguably, the largest impacts are from
	the targeted carbon pricing itself, which generates macroeconomic
	effects, terms-of-trade changes, and shifts in global energy demand
	and prices; it also changes the relative prices of certain
	energy-intensive goods. This paper studies how climate policies
	implemented in certain major economies (the European Union and the
	United States) affect the global distribution of economic and
	environmental outcomes, and how these outcomes may be altered by
	complementary policies aimed at addressing carbon leakage.

	day-care availability, and a cultural climate that is supportive of
	women's full-time work, Norwegian women still have one of the
	highest female part-time rates in Europe. Longer working hours
	among women would clearly alleviate the lack of labour in many
	sectors of the economy, but this reserve may be difficult to
	mobilise as previous research have shown that large proportions of
	female full-time workers are discontent with their working hours.
	In this article we examine whether this is true even today, and
	identify factors that may facilitate or impede working-hours
	satisfaction among female full-timers based on recent data from the
	Norwegian Labour Force Surveys. Contrary to past research, we find
	that most women are satisfied with their full-time hours. Still,
	young children in the household are a strong deterrent of full-time
	contentment, as is long working hours for the spouse, if women are
	married. Full-time contentment also varies with occupation, but the
	main job-deterrent seems to be non-standard working hours such as
	shift and rota.

Abstract: Two districts of Oslo started to offer five-year-old children

	intervention on the school performance of the children from
	immigrant families 10 years later (age 16). Our
	difference-in-difference approach takes advantage of the variation
	caused by the intervention being implemented in two districts in
	Oslo, leaving other similar districts unaffected. The grade point
	average of girls increases substantially more in the intervention
	districts than in the comparison districts; resulting in an effect
	estimate of more than a quarter of a standard deviation. There is
	no significant change in boys’ performance, and no support for
	disadvantageous effects on non-cognitive outcomes.

Classification-JEL: Q48; Q54; Q58
Abstract: The EU Parliament has agreed on a target of a 20 % share of
	renewables in the EU’s total energy consumption by 2020. To achieve
	the target, the Council has adopted mandatory differentiated
	national targets for each of the Member States. In this paper we
	consider the potential for cost reductions by allowing for trade in
	green certificates across Member States. We show that
	differentiated national targets cannot ensure a cost effective
	implementation of the overall target for EU’s green energy
	consumption. Trade in green certificates can ensure a cost
	effective distribution of green energy production, but the national
	targets prevents a cost effective distribution of energy
	consumption. Nevertheless, our numerical model indicates that
	EU-wide trade in green certificates may cut the EU’s total cost of
	fulfilling the renewable target by as much as 70 % compared to a
	situation with no trade. However, the design of green certificate
	markets may have large impact on the distribution of costs across
	countries.

Abstract: Popular instruments to regulate consumption of oil in the

	efficiency. Their impacts on oil consumption and price vary. One
	important factor is the market setting. We show that if market
	power is present in the oil market, the directions of change in
	consumption and price may contrast those in a competitive market.
	As a result, the market setting impacts not only the effectiveness
	of the policy instruments to reduce oil consumption, but also terms
	of trade and carbon leakage. In particular, we show that under
	monopoly, reduced oil consumption due to increased fuel efficiency
	will unambiguously increase the price of oil.

Abstract: There is massive cross-sectional evidence that children of more

	causal interpretation of this association is weak. Within a rich
	census level data set for Norway, we examine the causal
	relationship using two approaches for identification: cousins with
	twin parents and adopted children. In line with most of the
	literature, we find no effect of mothers’ education on children’s
	school performance using the children-of-twins approach. However,
	for adopted children, mother’s education has a positive effect, but
	only a third of the size of the effect found in biological
	relationships in adopting families. Carefully tracking the work
	experience of parents during offspring childhood, we find no
	support for the hypothesis that the small causal effects of
	parental education can be explained by detrimental effects of
	higher labour force participation among more educated mothers.

Classification-JEL: C21; H42
Abstract: Increased household recycling is a policy goal in many countries.
	Household recycling is, to a large extent, based on voluntary
	efforts. It is thus interesting to understand the mechanisms behind
	household voluntary contributions to recycling, and how they are
	affected by various policy measures. In this study, we describe the
	differences in factors affecting household recycling activities
	across 10 OECD countries. We find that the most important
	motivations for household recycling are the belief that recycling
	is good for the environment and that recycling is a civic duty.
	Increasing the supply of recycling services has a significant
	effect on household recycling, and door-to-door collection and
	drop-off centres are the two most effective methods in this
	respect. Furthermore, the results indicate that the design of
	monetary incentives may be important to avoid crowding out of
	morally motivated voluntary contributions, illustrated by the
	Korean success with volume-based fees.

Abstract: We derive aggregate supply (AS) relationships for an

	simulations. The specification of the AS curve, as a PCM or a
	WPECM, is shown to be important for all aspects of the model’s
	solution, but within each model also the detailed parameterization
	is of qualitative importance. For example, endogenous cyclical
	fuctuations are typical for both nominal and real variables, e.g.

Abstract: This paper concerns the effect of employment status on second-
	and third-birth intensities for Norwegian mothers in the period
	1994-2002. Due to unobserved heterogeneity possibly affecting both
	the birth and the employment processes we employ a simultaneous
	equations approach for hazard models, originally suggested by
	Lillard (1993). Our results show that there is a slightly positive
	effect of currently being in employment on the second-birth
	intensity, whereas the third-birth intensity is larger for women
	who are currently non-employed, even when unobserved heterogeneity
	is taken into account. This suggests that even in a society such as
	the Norwegian in which there is a high compatibility between
	motherhood and labour market attachment there are still certain
	costs associated with childbearing and that this is taken into
	account by Norwegian women, in particular when it comes to the
	progression to third child.

Abstract: This paper is concerned with the problem of ranking Lorenz curves
	in situations where the Lorenz curves intersect and no unambiguous
	ranking can be attained without introducing weaker ranking criteria
	than first-degree Lorenz dominance. To deal with such situations
	Aaberge (2009) introduced two alternative sequences of nested
	dominance criteria for Lorenz curves which was proved to
	characterize two separate systems of nested subfamilies of
	inequality measures. This paper uses the obtained characterization
	results to arrange the members of two different generalized Gini
	families of inequality measures into subfamilies according to their
	relationship to Lorenz dominance of various degrees. Since the
	various criteria of higher degree Lorenz dominance provide
	convenient computational methods, these results can be used to
	identify the largest subfamily of the generalized Gini families and
	thus the least restrictive social preferences required to reach
	unambiguous ranking of a set of Lorenz curves. From the
	weight-functions of these inequality measures we obtain intuitive
	interpretations of higher degree Lorenz dominance, which generally
	has been viewed as difficult to interpret because they involve
	assumptions about third and higher derivatives. To demonstrate the
	usefulness of these methods for empirical applications, we examine
	the time trend in income and earnings inequality of Norwegian males
	during the period 1967-2005.

Classification-JEL: D71; D91; I32
Abstract: This paper proposes a two-step aggregation method for measuring
	long-term income inequality and income mobility, where mobility is
	defined as an equalizer of long-term income. The first step
	consists of aggregating the income stream of each individual into a
	measure of permanent income, which accounts for the costs
	associated with income fluctuations and allows for credit market
	imperfections. The second step aggregates permanent incomes across
	individuals into measures of social welfare, inequality and
	mobility. To this end, we employ an axiomatic approach to justify
	the introduction of a generalized family of rank-dependent measures
	of inequality, where the distributional weights, as opposed to the
	Mehran-Yaari family, depend on income shares as well as on
	population shares. Moreover, a subfamily is shown to be associated
	with social welfare functions that have intuitively appealing
	interpretations. Further, the generalized family of inequality
	measures provides new interpretations of the Gini-coefficient.

Classification-JEL: D31; H72; I30
Abstract: Despite a broad consensus on the need to take into account the
	value of public services in distributional analysis, there is
	little reliable evidence on how the inclusion of such non-cash
	income actually affects poverty and inequality estimates. In
	particular, the equivalence scales applied to cash income are not
	necessarily appropriate when including non-cash income, because the
	receipt of public services is likely to be associated with
	particular needs. In this paper, we propose a theory-based
	framework designed to provide a coherent evaluation of the
	distributional impact of local public services. The valuation of
	public services, identification of target groups, allocation of
	expenditures to target groups, and adjustment for differences in
	needs are derived from a model of local government spending
	behaviour. Using Norwegian data from municipal accounts and
	administrative registers we find that the inclusion of non-cash
	income reduces income inequality by about 15 percent and poverty
	rates by almost one-third. However, adjusting for differences in
	needs for public services across population subgroups offsets about
	half the inequality reduction and some of the poverty decrease.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and apply a general framework for
	evaluating long-term income distributions according to the Equality

	on a permanent income measure defined as the minimum annual
	expenditure an individual would need in order to be as well off as
	he could be by undertaking inter-period income transfers. There is
	long-term ex-post inequality of opportunity if individuals who
	exert the same effort have different permanent incomes. In
	comparison, the ex-ante approach focuses on the expected permanent
	income for individuals with identical circumstances. Hence, the
	ex-ante approach pays attention to inequalities in expected
	permanent income between different types of individuals. To
	demonstrate the empirical relevance of a long-run perspective on
	EOp, we exploit a unique panel data from Norway on individuals’
	incomes over their working lifespan.

Keywords: Equality of opportunity; equality of outcome; labour supply;

Classification-JEL: D19; D63; H21; H24; H31
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to introduce and adopt a generalised
	version of Roemer's (1998) Equality of Opportunity (EOp) framework,
	which we call extended EOp, for analysing second-best optimal
	income taxation. Unlike the pure EOp criterion of Roemer (1998) the
	extended EOp criterion allows for alternative weighting profiles in
	the treatment of income differentials between as well as within
	types when types are defined by circumstances that are beyond
	people's control. This study uses parental education as a measure
	of exogenous circumstances. An empirical microeconometric model of
	labour supply in Italy is employed to simulate and identify income
	tax-transfer rules that are optimal according to the extended EOp
	criterion. We look for second-best optimality, i.e. the
	tax-transfer rules are not allowed to depend on family background,
	they only depend on income: family background is taken indirectly
	into account. The rules are defined by a universal (not
	individualized) lump-sum transfer (positive or negative) and by one
	or two marginal tax rates. A rather striking result of the analysis
	is that the optimal tax-transfer rule turns out to be a universal
	lump-sum tax (with marginal tax rates equal to zero), under
	Roemer's pure EOp criterion as well as under the generalised EOp
	criterion with moderate degrees of aversion to within-type
	inequality. A higher degree of within-type inequality aversion
	instead produces EOp-optimal rules with positive marginal tax
	rates. When the EOp-version of the Gini welfare function is
	adopted, the optimal tax rule turns out to be close to the actual
	1993 Italian tax system, if not for the important difference of
	prescribing a universal lump-sum positive transfer of 3,500,000 ITL
	(= 1807 Euros), which has no comparable counterpart in the actual
	system. On the other hand, when using the conventional equality of
	outcome (EO) criterion, the pure lump-sum tax always turns out to
	be optimal, at least with respect to the classes of two- and
	three-parameter rules. We also compute optimal rules under the
	additional constraint that universal lump-sum taxes are not
	feasible. Overall, the results do not conform to the perhaps common
	expectation that the EO criterion is more supportive of
	“interventionist” (redistributive) policies than an extended EOp
	approach.

Abstract: The house price level is a function of buyers’ realized home
	equity, and buyers’ realized home equity is a function of the house
	price level. This interdependence follows from the fact that buyers
	are sellers in the same market. This article examines under what
	conditions this leads to a possible upward-sloping demand curve
	with a potentially unstable equilibrium. I employ a parsimonious
	model with two kinds of buyers, and utilize an augmented
	Slusky-equation that decomposes Walrasian demand into a
	substitution, an income, and an endowment income effect. The model
	demonstrates that instability may occur if first-time buyers’
	demand is sufficiently inelastic, leverage is stretched,
	debt-financing is common, and nth-time buyers are relatively more
	frequent than first-time buyers. Regulation on leverage and a
	capital gains tax reduce the likelihood of upward-sloping demand.
	The article utilizes new data from Norway to examine an empirical
	indicator of an equity accelerator of house prices and finds that
	over the period 2000-2008 the value of all housing transactions
	exceeded the aggregate net growth of mortgages by 50%, indicating
	substantial equity financing. In one year, 2008, the value of
	aggregate housing transactions was double the growth in net
	mortgages.

	long run consumption is homogeneous in income and wealth and there
	is also a significant effect from after-tax real interest rates. A
	change in the correlation pattern between real interest rates and
	wealth, which is related to a change in the monetary policy regime,
	is the reason why both variables need to be included in the long

Abstract: Our point of departure is that a group of developed countries
	invest in the development of greenhouse gas (GHG) abatement
	technologies both at home and in developing countries. Such
	investments reduce the cost of future GHG abatement, and influence
	the future GHG abatement choices of both developed and developing
	countries. We show how a common permit market affects the
	industrialized countries' strategic investment decisions. As
	opposed to a situation without a permit market, the industrialized
	countries may want to overinvest in new GHG abatement technologies
	both at home and abroad. That is, they increase their R&D
	investment to such an extent that the cost reductions from the

Abstract: This paper extends the ordinary quasi-likelihood estimator for
	stochastic volatility models based on non-Gaussian
	Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes to vector processes. Despite the
	fact that multivariate modeling of asset returns is essential for
	portfolio optimization and risk management -- major areas of
	financial analysis -- the literature on multivariate modeling of
	asset prices in continuous time is sparse, both with regard to
	theoretical and applied results. This paper uses non-Gaussian
	OU-processes as building blocks for multivariate models for high
	frequency financial data. The OU framework allows exact discrete
	time transition equations that can be represented on a linear state
	space form. We show that a computationally feasible
	quasi-likelihood function can be constructed by means of the Kalman
	filter also in the case of high-dimensional vector processes. The
	framework is applied to Euro/NOK and US Dollar/NOK exchange rate
	data for the period 2.1.1989-4.2.2010.

Abstract: This article analyses factors behind underemployment in Norway
	and has a focus on gender. The analysis, based on Labour Force
	Survey data, shows that economic fluctuations during the latest one
	and a half decade bring about changing underemployment levels of
	both women and men. The Norwegian labour market is strongly gender
	segregated and the processes and characteristics of underemployment
	differ between male and female dominated labour market sectors. The
	former sectors are generally more exposed or sensitive to economic
	fluctuations than the latter. It is indicated that underemployed
	men are predominantly temporarily expelled on part-time basis from
	their jobs, while women are to a larger extent permanently excluded
	from longer working-hour contracts in their jobs.

Abstract: The experience of liberalized electricity markets’ ability to

	analyze how liberalized markets allocate power in the short and
	long run through the interaction between the spot and end-user
	markets. We show that totally inelastic demand in the spot market
	does not necessarily result in market failure in a shortage
	situation, as long as price incentives are transferred to the
	end-user markets. We argue that the market does not have to run
	optimally to handle a shortage situation, and that problems with
	short- or long-run allocation of power arise when price
	restrictions in end-user markets results in a higher demand than
	that which may sustain the energy situation over time.

Classification-JEL: C02; C23; K40
Abstract: In the criminal career literature, the individual-level age-crime
	relationship is commonly modelled using generalized linear mixed
	models, where between-individual heterogeneity is then handled
	through specifying random effect(s) with some distribution. It is
	common to specify either a normal or discrete distribution for the
	random effects. However, there are also other options, and the
	choice of specification might have substantial effect on the
	results. In this article, we compare how various methods perform on
	Norwegian longitudinal data on registered crimes. We also present
	an approach that might be new to criminologists: the Poisson-gamma
	regression model. This model is interpretable, parsimonious, and
	quick to compute. For our data, the distributional assumptions have
	not dramatic effect on substantive interpretation. In criminology,
	the mixture distribution is also of theoretical interest by its own
	right, and we conclude that a gamma distribution is reasonable. We
	emphasize the importance of comparing multiple methods in any
	setting where the distributional assumptions are uncertain.

Abstract: The European Union (EU) identified some positive and negative

	choice of policy instruments to promote renewable energy production
	(subsidies versus green certificates) affects the optimal level of
	energy consumption taxes. A second-best optimum for the EU cannot
	be achieved without a coordination of energy taxes and renewable

Abstract: Environmental policy analyses often draw on stated preferences,

	may create systematic differences between reported and real

	difficult. In this paper, we model how social and moral norms and
	the image we would like to project affect reported and actual
	behavior. We illustrate the model using data from a stated
	preference survey reporting environment-related household behavior
	in ten OECD countries. We find clear evidence of how norms and
	identity statements affect reported behavior. We also find evidence
	of the misrepresentation of preferences, both among respondents
	complying with and protesting the norm. Over- and understatements
	appear to be evenly distributed, and is thus not expected to
	significantly bias the mean results.

Keywords: Trade liberalisation; import prices; pricing-to-market; exchange

Classification-JEL: C22; C32; C43; E31
Abstract: Previous studies on the relationship between exchange rates and
	traded goods prices typically find evidence of incomplete
	pass-through, usually explained by pricing-to-market behaviour.
	Although economic theory predicts that incomplete pass-through may
	also be linked to presence of non-tariff barriers to trade,
	variables reflecting such a link is rarely included in existing
	empirical models. In this paper, we estimate a pricing-to-market
	model for Norwegian import prices on textiles and wearing apparels,
	controlling explicitly for the removal of non-tariff barriers to
	trade and the shift in imports from high-cost to low-cost countries
	through a Törnqvist price index based measure of foreign prices. We
	show that this measure of foreign prices unlike standard measures
	used in the literature is likely to produce unbiased estimates of
	the degree of pass-through, and thereby also the extent of
	pricing-to-market behaviour. Finally, we demonstrate that the
	estimated import price equation is reasonably stable and exhibits
	no serious forecasting failures. These findings contradict the
	hypothesis that pass-through has changed alongside trade policy
	shifts during the second half of the 1990s and the monetary policy
	regime shift in 2001.

Abstract: We examine the potential of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS)

	CCS technologies will reduce carbon emissions substantially in the
	absence of investment subsidies, and how the availability of CCS
	technologies may affect electricity prices and the amount of
	renewable electricity. To this end we augment a multi-market
	equilibrium model of the European energy markets with CCS
	electricity technologies. The CCS technologies are characterized by
	costs and technical efficiencies synthesized from a number of
	recent cost estimates and CCS technology reviews. Our simulations
	indicate that with realistic values for carbon prices, new CCS coal
	power plants become profitable, totally replacing non-CCS coal
	power investments and to a large extent replacing new wind power.
	New CCS gas power also becomes profitable, but does not replace
	non-CCS gas power fully. Substantially lower CCS costs, through
	subsidies on technological development or deployment, would be
	necessary to make CCS modification of old coal and gas power plants
	profitable.

Abstract: The article analyses part-time work, both so-called voluntary and

	logistic regression models, including human capital, life-course-
	and household characteristics and job characteristics as
	independent variables. We use Norwegian Labour Force Survey data.
	The analysis shows that part-time work is a strongly gendered
	phenomenon, not only because it occurs much more frequently among
	women than among men, but also because the causes of part-time
	differ between the sexes. We find, as expected, that involuntary
	part-time is mainly tied to job characteristics, whereas voluntary
	part time is equally predicted by worker characteristics and job
	characteristics. The effect of gender is strong and significant,
	however less significant when controlling for job characteristics
	than when controlling for worker characteristics.

Abstract: This paper aims to develop new methods for statistical inference

	uses indirect inference methods: First, a quasi-likelihood for the

	approximative Gaussian state space representation of the OU-based
	model. Next, simulations are made from the data generating OU-model
	for given parameter values. The indirect inference estimator is the
	parameter value in the OU-model which gives the best "match"
	between the quasi-likelihood estimator for the actual data and the
	quasi-likelihood estimator for the simulated data. Our method is
	applied to Euro/NOK and US Dollar/NOK daily exchange rates for the
	period 1.7.1989 until 15.12.2008. Accompanying R-package, that
	interfaces C++ code is documented and can be downloaded.

Abstract: The purpose of environmental taxes is to correct the market when
	it fails to take environmental damages into account, i.e. to
	internalize the Pigouvian element. In addition, fiscal taxes are
	levied on both polluting and clean goods, which may follow the
	Ramsey principle. In practical policy, environmental and fiscal
	taxes are conceptually intertwined. This mixture complicates the
	calculation of the extent and the evaluation of the effects of
	environmental taxes. Eurostat, OECD and IEA include all taxes
	related to energy, transport and pollution, and most resource taxes
	in their international measurement of environmentally related
	taxes. Consequently, numerous fiscal taxes are added together with
	the environmental taxes. This article discusses the distinctions
	between the Pigouvian and the fiscal taxes in light of tax theory.
	The revenues following the Eurostat et al. statistical basis
	deviate significantly from the revenues from the environmental
	taxes defined on the basis of theory. Steps should be taken to
	harmonize the international statistics of environmental taxes with
	economic tax theory.

	unavoidable, and will propagate to various induced household

	provides a framework for evaluating the statistical accuracy of
	these register-based household statistics, and illustrate its use
	through an application to the Norwegian register household data.

Abstract: We explore the relationship between formal employment and

	released from prison in 2003 for several years. By the end of 2006,
	27 percent are re-incarcerated. Using a Cox proportional hazard
	model that controls for a host of individual characteristics, we
	find that the hazard of re-incarceration is 63 percent lower for
	those getting employed compared to those not getting employed.
	While some of the moderating association between employment and
	re-incarceration is accounted for by observable individual
	characteristics, the substantially lower hazard for those getting
	employed indicates a possibility of a considerable benign effect of
	employment on recidivism. Our analysis thus provides further
	indication that provision of employment opportunities can
	facilitate the return to society after release from prison.

Abstract: Taxes on housing consumption have attractive features. They can
	enhance overall efficiency, function as automatic stabilizers, and
	work progressively. Implementation, however, requires a careful
	balance between economic ambition and political reality. This
	article suggests a 5-stage procedure: identification; estimation;
	data acquisition and combination; empirical investigation; and tax
	function construction. It illustrates how to implement by employing
	the rental-equivalence principle to estimate recent values of
	owner-occupied housing consumption in a cross-section of Norwegian
	households by imputing rent for owners based on observed rents in
	rental markets. It analyzes the distribution of imputed rent over
	the income range, and demonstrates that imputed rent is a necessary
	good. A simple tax scheme on real households in a dataset from
	2006, shows how a housing tax can be structured with attractive
	features. Such a tax scheme would, in contrast to the current
	interest payment subsidy, work counter-cyclically and could, if
	used as a substitute for income taxes, reduce deadweight losses
	from labor income taxes. In its suggested form, it would generate
	approximately 12 billion NOK in revenue for Norway.

Abstract: This paper examines how ambitious climate policies and subsidies
	to carbon capture may affect international energy prices and market
	shares in the power market. A detailed numerical model of the
	international energy markets is used. We first conclude that an
	ambitious climate policy alone will have substantial effects in the
	power market, with considerable growth in renewable power
	production and eventually use of carbon capture. Gas power
	production will also benefit from such a policy. Subsidising carbon
	capture and storage (CCS) will significantly accelerate the use of
	this technology. Nevertheless, total production of coal and gas
	power (with or without CCS) is only marginally increased, as the
	subsidy mainly leads to installation of CCS equipment on existing
	plants, reducing the efficiency from these plants. Consequently,
	electricity prices are almost unchanged, and the substantial growth
	in renewable power production is hardly affected by the subsidies
	to CCS.

Title: The investment and financing decisions of closely held firms when

Keywords: Dividend taxation; shareholder income tax; corporate financial

Classification-JEL: G32; G35; H24; H25
Abstract: This paper analyzes a tax system where personal share income in
	excess of the risk-free return on equity (the equity premium) is
	taxed. The rate of return allowance (RRA) in the Norwegian
	shareholder income tax system is, to the best of our knowledge, the
	first attempt of implementing such taxation in practice, and
	represents an innovation. This paper analyzes the effects of this
	form of taxation on the investment and financing decisions of
	closely held firms. Such firms typically have limited access to
	capital markets, but a high degree of financial flexibility that
	allows them to participate in tax planning. We show that even if
	the RRA reduces distortions compared to traditional dividend
	taxation, the tax system is not neutral if the shareowners'
	discount rate exceeds the risk-free interest rate used in the
	computation of the RRA. We find empirical support to the view that
	a tax on shareholder income without sufficient allowance for the
	opportunity cost of capital discourages investment in corporate
	equity. This finding is particularly relevant for entrepreneurship
	and investment in closely held firms.

Keywords: crime; plant closure; plant downsizing; displacement
Classification-JEL: J12; J63; J65
Abstract: We estimate the effect of exposure to plant closure on crime
	using an individual-level panel data set containing criminal
	charges for all unmarried and employed Norwegian men below the age
	of 40. Men originally employed in plants that subsequently closed
	are 14 percent more likely to be charged of a crime than comparable
	men in stable plants. There is no difference in charge rates prior
	to closure, supporting a causal interpretation of our result.
	Within crime categories, we find no effect of plant closure on
	property crime, perhaps because closure has a small and
	insignificant effect on subsequent earnings. We estimate an effect
	of plant closure on categories of non-acquisitive crime, suggesting
	a role for mental distress or idleness. A role for idleness is
	supported by evidence that the effects of plant closure on crime
	tend to be more pronounced for crimes committed during the week
	than on weekends.

Classification-JEL: C7; D12; H1; H31
Abstract: A simulation model consisting of a representative consumer for
	each Scandinavian country is constructed and calibrated, in which
	consumers consume two goods: spirits and 'other goods'. Spirits is
	exposed to cross-border shopping, and the countries engage in tax
	competition. The equilibrium tax rates show large price
	differentials on spirits in Scandinavia. The findings also suggest
	that Norway and Denmark pay more attention to cross-border shopping
	and tax competition when setting the tax rates compared to Sweden.
	Furthermore, the equilibrium tax rates are rather robust with
	respect to the type of game that we consider, due to the fact that
	the utility maximizing tax rate for each country is rather
	insensitive with respect to other countries’ tax rates.
	Nevertheless, the sequential game equilibrium consists of somewhat
	higher taxes and utility levels for each country compared to the
	simultaneous game equilibrium, meaning that the former equilibrium
	Pareto-dominates the latter.

Abstract: The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is an offset mechanism
	designed to reduce the overall cost of implementing a given target
	for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in industrialized Annex B
	countries of the Kyoto Protocol, by shifting some of the emission
	reductions to Non-Annex B countries. This paper analyzes how CDM
	projects may lead to leakage of emissions elsewhere in Non-Annex B
	countries, taking into account also potential (negative) leakage
	effects from less emission reductions in Annex B. Leakage occurs
	because emissions reductions under a CDM project may affect market
	equilibrium in regional and/or global energy and product markets,
	and thereby increase emissions elsewhere. We find that overall
	leakage typically will be positive and sizeable, thus leading to an
	overall increase in global GHG emissions when CDM projects are
	undertaken. The leakage rate is greatest when the different fossil
	fuel markets are more segregated.

Abstract: This study examines the link between divorced nonresident
	fathers’ proximity and children’s long-run outcomes using
	high-quality data from Norwegian population registers. We follow
	(from birth to young adulthood) 15,992 children born into married
	households in Norway in the years 1975-1979 whose parents divorce
	during his or her childhood. We observe the proximity of the child
	to his or her father in each year following the divorce and link
	proximity to children’s educational and economic outcomes in young
	adulthood, controlling for a wide range of observable
	characteristics of the parents and the child. Our results show that
	closer proximity to the father following a divorce has, on average,
	a modest negative association with offspring’s young-adult
	outcomes. The negative associations are stronger among children of
	highly-educated fathers. Complementary Norwegian survey data show
	that highly-educated fathers report more post-divorce conflict with
	their ex-wives as well as more contact with their children
	(measured in terms of the number of nights that the child spends at
	the fathers’ house). Consequently, the father’s relocation to a
	more distant location following the divorce may shelter the child
	from disruptions in the structure of the child’s life as they split
	time between households and/or from post-divorce interparental
	conflict.

	link information on these youths with information on family
	earnings for several years. In a criminal career perspective, our
	outcome variable is the age of first offence (onset). We find that
	family academic resources are more important than family income for
	all kinds of offences, except for serious theft.

Abstract: This article presents a critical review of the taxonomic theory

	considered to be strong, at least by some. I discuss along three
	lines. First, to what extent the taxonomy should be interpreted
	literally. Second, whether the suggested mechanisms are likely to
	produce the hypothesized groups. Third, whether some of the most
	important empirical evidence really does support the theory. I
	conclude that the theoretical arguments are surprisingly unclear on
	key issues and that the empirical evidence is highly problematic.

Classification-JEL: C31; C14; J13
Abstract: Many empirical studies specify outcomes as a linear function of
	endogenous regressors when conducting instrumental variable (IV)
	estimation. We show that commonly used tests for treatment effects,
	selection bias, and treatment effect heterogeneity are biased if
	the true relationship is non-linear. In particular, using linear
	models can only lead to under-rejection of the null hypothesis of
	no treatment effects. In light of these results, we re-examine the
	recent evidence suggesting that family size has no causal effect on
	children's education. Following common practice, a linear IV
	estimator has been used, assuming constant marginal effects of
	additional children across family sizes. We show that the
	conclusion of no causal effect of family size is an artifact of the
	specification of a linear model, which masks significant marginal
	family size effects. Estimating a model that is non-parametric in
	family size, we find that family size matters substantially for
	children's educational attainment, but in a non-monotonic way. Our
	findings illustrate that IV estimation of models which relax
	linearity restrictions is an important addition to empirical
	research, particularly when OLS estimation and theory suggests the
	possibility of non-linear causal effects.

	manufacturing sectors over the period 1988-2003. We find that
	tariff reductions have stimulated labor productivity when
	instrumented by multilateral tariffs. The OLS estimates show
	downward bias and supports the understanding that the government
	has given priority to tariff reductions in sectors with slow

Abstract: We analyse welfare effects of supporting general versus emission

	capture and storage. We study public revenue neutral policy
	alternatives targeted towards general R&D and emission saving R&D.
	Support to general R&D is the welfare superior, independent of the
	level of international carbon price. However, the welfare gap
	between the two R&D policy alternatives is reduced if the carbon
	price increases.

	new method is superior to existing methods, like the much used

	is empirically important: Existing methods yield erroneous wealth

Abstract: There is a heated debate in the US and Canada, as well as in many

	care and child development are scarce, limited to short-run

	of subsidized, universally accessible child care in Norway,
	addressing the impact on the long-run outcomes of children. Our
	precise difference-in-difference estimates show that child care had
	strong positive effects on children's educational attainment and
	labor market participation, and also reduced welfare dependency.
	17,500 new child care places produces around 6,200 additional years
	of education. In line with these results, we find that children
	exposed to child care delay child bearing and family formation as
	adults. Subsample estimations by child's sex and mother's education
	suggest that good access to subsidized child care levels the
	playing field. A battery of specification checks support our
	empirical strategy.

Abstract: Standard practice of estimating purchasing power parities (PPP)
	involves using prices, in domestic currencies, of a common basket
	of goods and services, then calculating the price-equalizing
	exchange rate. In this article, I substitute observed consumer
	behavior for price data. On the assumption that an Engel curve for
	food reflects material standard of living, I estimate Engel curves
	for food for the United States and Norway. This allows us to
	calculate the exchange rate required for re-aligning the two
	curves, i.e. the incomes needed in the two countries to purchase
	the same standard of living. Since different relative prices or
	preferences for food can affect the position and slope of the
	curves, I also estimate the Engel curves of non-food, for which the
	effect is opposite. Not only does this provide a band of upper and
	lower bounds of PPP, it also improves upon the assumption of
	preference homogeneity underlying conventional PPP-computations.
	Using Consumer Expenditure (CES) data for 2001, I obtain estimated
	PPP-levels for the rate of the Norwegian krone (NOK) versus the
	U.S. dollar (USD) in the 5.38-7.90 range. The average rate
	1977-2007 was 6.81 NOK per USD. The conventional estimates of PPP
	from the World Bank and OECD are 8.84 and 9.18 NOK per USD,

	process. We find some support for the hypothesis that family
	formation inhibit criminal behaviors, but our results are less
	clear-cut than those reported by previous research. Most
	importantly, the declines in offending in the years prior to
	experiencing family transitions do not seem to be of a permanent

Abstract: I study the effects of the level of disability benefits on
	disability uptake. Estimation of such effects is difficult because
	individual levels of disability pension benefits are closely
	related to individual characteristics that may also affect
	disability uptake through other mechanisms. I exploit variation in
	disability benefits related to individual characteristics only
	through birth cohort, due to special rules of the phasing in of the
	Norwegian National insurance scheme. These rules imply a nonlinear
	relationship between birth cohort and disability benefit level,
	which allows me to estimate the effects of benefits based on
	between-cohort differences, while controlling for age and year
	effects and hence implicitly linear trends in birth cohorts. The
	results show a statistically significant and strong positive effect
	of benefits on transitions to disability. The robustness of the
	results is studied in a number of tests based on sample partitions
	and other groups that are not exposed to the nonlinear relationship
	between birth cohort and disability benefit level.

Abstract: The consumption of storable goods does not necessarily equal
	purchases during a period because of changes in stock. In many
	cases, we have information about expenditures only, not
	consumption. A method is developed to obtain an estimate of
	consumption and changes in stock when only expenditure data are
	available. In addition to expenditure data, the method requires
	discrete information about the utilization of available equipment
	complementary to the storable good in consumption. Household energy
	consumption is used as an illustration, applying data from the
	Norwegian survey of consumer expenditure.

Keywords: Electricity consumption; demand charge tariff; demand response
Classification-JEL: D10; Q40
Abstract: This paper analyses the demand response from residential
	electricity consumers to a demand charge grid tariff. The tariff
	charges the maximum hourly peak consumption in each of the winter
	months January, February and December, thus giving incentives to
	reduce peak consumption. We use hourly electricity consumption data
	from 443 households, as well as data on their network and power
	prices, the local temperature, wind speed and hours of daylight.
	The panel data set is analysed with a fixed effects regression
	model. The estimates indicate a demand reduction between 0.07 and
	0.27 kWh/h in response to the tariff. This is on average a 5
	percent reduction, with a maximum reduction of 9 percent in hour 8.
	The consumers did not receive any information on their continuous
	consumption or any reminders when the tariff was in effect. It is
	likely that the consumption reductions would have been even higher
	with more information to the consumers.

Classification-JEL: D12; D6; H2; H31
Abstract: The partial revenue from each indirect tax and the total revenue
	from all indirect taxes on consumer goods are derived as functions
	of all commodity prices, the tax rates of each commodity, total
	expenditure and demographic variables using a complete demand
	system. Within this framework we define Dupuit curves, or Laffer
	curves, and analyze their existence and maximum points
	theoretically and empirically. The macro demand system is based on
	exact aggregation across all households in the economy, and on
	exact aggregation across commodities within a detailed
	non-homogeneous utility tree. An empirical application for Norway
	with 55 commodity groups is presented. For beer, wine, spirits and
	tobacco, consumers can choose among buying at home, cross-border
	shopping/ tax-free shopping and smuggling. These substitution
	possibilities increase substantially the price elasticities for
	these goods. The partial revenue from wine as function of the tax
	share on wine has a single maximum value close to the actual tax
	rate in Norway in 1999, conditioned on all the other exogenous
	variables. The total revenue as a function of the tax share on wine
	also has a single maximum value, larger than that for the partial
	revenue. The same results are valid for spirits. For beer and
	tobacco there is no revenue maximizing tax share.

Abstract: Research and development (R&D) play a pivotal role for innovation
	and productivity growth, and knowledge spillovers can make the case
	for public support to private R&D. In small and open economies,
	absorption of foreign knowledge through exports and imports can be
	even more decisive for economic growth than domestic innovation.
	This macro economic analysis investigates how policies should be
	formed in order to reap the largest productivity effects, when both
	these sources of growth interplay. In particular, the firms’
	capacity to absorb knowledge from abroad depends on domestic R&D,
	and this reinforces the efficiency arguments for stimulating R&D.
	We find that from a welfare perspective, export promotion of
	R&D-based technologies proves slightly more efficient than R&D
	support.

Abstract: An important policy question is whether research and development

	R&D in other more mature technologies. In this paper I analyze if
	innovation externalities caused by knowledge spillovers from
	private firms may warrant a differentiated R&D policy. I find that
	R&D in emerging and mature technologies should not be subsidized
	equally. The reason is that R&D in the two technologies is not
	equally undersupplied in the market due to differences in their
	knowledge stocks. R&D in the mature technology should be subsidized
	more when the sum of the output elasticities with respect to labor
	and knowledge in R&D production is high, while R&D in the emerging
	technology should be subsidized more when the elasticities are low.

Keywords: Immigration; assimilation; employment; earnings
Classification-JEL: J20
Abstract: Studies on the earnings assimilation of immigrants have
	traditionally focused exclusively on immigrants in employment.
	However, given evidence of immigrants' difficulties in entering and
	remaining in the labor market, restricting the population to those
	in employment may entail a selection bias. In addition, the primary
	variable of interest in such studies is often the duration of
	residence or the years since migration (YSM), which is interpreted
	as a proxy for potential labor market experience in the host
	country. The appropriateness of that proxy will, however, also
	depend on the extent to which immigrants are able to quickly enter
	and remain in the labor market. This study thus re-examines
	evidence on the earnings assimilation of immigrants in light of
	selection into the labor market and with better information on
	actual labor market experience in the host country. The findings
	suggest that a major revision of previous conclusions about the
	earnings assimilation of immigrants in Norway may be in order.

	Furthermore, the interdependence between credit and asset prices
	creates a mechanism by which the effects of shocks persist and
	amplify. However, while innovations to asset prices and credit do
	cause short-run movements in production, and while real activity
	spurs credit, such innovations do not precede real economy
	movements in the long run. Hence, there obviously is a case for

Classification-JEL: D43; Q54
Abstract: A group of small competitive permits traders facing an
	imperfectly competitive permit market may consider cooperation
	(merger) to act strategically in the permit market. It is a
	well-known result in the literature that the horizontal merger of
	Cournot players may be unprofitable because of the response of
	nonmerging agents (a negative strategic effect). We show that the
	strategic effect of a merger among competitive agents substantially
	differs from the strategic effect of a merger among Cournot
	players. Furthermore, we show how the profitability of a merger
	depends on whether the merged agents are on the same side of the
	market as the preexisting dominant agent(s). These results show how
	the expected competitive environment in the permit market may
	determine how potentially large traders such as the US, and group
	of small, competitive traders, such as the EU countries, organize
	their permit trade in any follow-up agreement to the Kyoto
	protocol.

Abstract: In this paper we develop likelihood based methods for statistical

	of schooling and earnings. The model for schooling choice is
	assumed to be an ordered probit model, whereas the earnings
	equation contains variables that are flexible transformations of
	schooling and experience, with corresponding coefficients that are
	allowed to be heterogeneous across individuals. Under the
	assumption that the distribution of the random terms of the model
	can be expressed as a particular finite mixture of multinormal
	distributions, we show that the joint probability distribution for
	schooling and earnings can be expressed on closed form. In an
	application of our method on Norwegian data, we find that the mixed
	Gaussian model offers a substantial improvement in fit to the
	(heavy-tailed) empirical distribution of log-earnings compared to a
	multinormal benchmark model.

Abstract: Norwegian business spending on R&D is low by OECD standards. To

	and to some extent the development of new products for the firm.
	Firms that collaborate with other firms are more likely to be
	successful in their innovation activities. However, the scheme does

Classification-JEL: J13; J18
Abstract: We address the relationship between family policies and fertility
	in Norway, including three somewhat different policies: parental
	leave, formal childcare, and the childcare cash benefit. Norwegian
	family policy has been considered dualistic, giving priority to
	both dual-earner support and general family support. Our data are
	administrative register data covering the period 1995–2002. The
	analysis shows that policies that promote father involvement in
	childcare and gender equality are positively associated with timing
	of second births, while policies giving more general family support
	are positively associated with timing of third births. The
	so-called "double-tracked" family policy seems to apply to
	different couples in a positive matter. An important insight of
	this paper is that both policies designed to improve reconciliation
	of work and family, and policies designed to improve childcare
	choices for parents, are indeed popular; however, in terms of
	fertility outcomes, there is wide heterogeneity in how they respond
	to the policies.

	workplaces limiting father’s leave, except in workplaces where
	there are high costs involved. Parental leave practices involving

Classification-JEL: C31; C42; C81; D12; D31; I32
Abstract: This paper examines the performance of a particular method for
	predicting poverty. The method is a supplement to the approach of
	measuring poverty through a fully-fledged household expenditure
	survey. As most developing countries cannot justify the expenses of
	frequent household expenditure surveys, low cost methods are of
	interest, and such models have been developed and used. The basic
	idea is a model for predicting the proportion of poor households in
	a population based on estimates from a total consumption regression
	relation, using data from a household expenditure survey. As a
	result, the model links the proportion of poor households to the
	explanatory variables of the consumption relation. These
	explanatory variables are fast to collect and are easy to measure.
	Information on the explanatory variables may be collected through
	annual light surveys. Several applications have shown that this
	information, together with the poverty model, can produce poverty
	estimates with confidence intervals of a similar magnitude as the
	poverty estimates from the household expenditure surveys. There is,
	however, limited evidence for how well the methods perform in
	predicting poverty from other surveys. A series of seven household
	expenditure surveys conducted in Uganda in the period 1993-2006 are
	available, allowing us to test the predictive ability of the
	models. We have tested the poverty models by using data from one
	survey to predict the proportion of poor households in other
	surveys, and vice versa. All the models predict similar poverty
	trends, whereas the respective levels are predicted differently.
	Although in most cases the predictions are precise, sometimes they
	differ significantly from the poverty level estimated from the
	survey directly. A long time span between surveys may explain some
	of these cases, as do large and sudden changes in poverty.

Abstract: The regional natural gas markets are expected to gradually become

	prices and trade patterns. We use a numerical model of the
	international energy markets, with detailed modelling of regional
	gas production and international gas transport. Scenarios with
	different assumptions about future demand and supply conditions are
	simulated. Our results suggest that trade between continents will
	grow considerably over the next couple of decades, and that prices
	in the main import regions will remain around current levels.
	However, significant constraints on exports from the Middle East
	may alter this picture.

Abstract: When private goods are publicly provided, government authorities
	have to determine the distribution of services on recipients. In
	this paper, the public service provider is assumed to maximize
	utility defined over service supply to different target groups,
	given a budget constraint. The production technology is target
	group specific and depends on the ability of each target group to
	produce service outcomes. Three benchmark allocation principles are
	identified: equality of treatment (ET), equality of outcome (EO)
	and equality of marginal cost (EMC). These principles can be
	considered to be consistent with special cases of a public
	preference model, which allows for compromises between different
	allocation principles. The condition of technological dominance
	implies that there is a clear-cut equity-productivity trade-off,
	whereas violations of this condition may reduce the significance of
	the trade-off.

	run fiscal sustainability by reducing the growth in public old-age
	expenditures, (2) strengthen labour supply incentives, and (3)
	maintain the main redistributive features of the present system. We
	assess to what extent the reform is likely to achieve these three
	goals, using two empirical models iteratively: We combine a
	detailed dynamic micro simulation of individual benefits and
	government pension expenditures with a CGE-model, which captures
	behavioural effects and equilibrium repercussions. We find that the
	pension reform improves fiscal balances substantially. Compared to
	a no-reform scenario, the payroll tax rate can be cut by 10
	percentage points in 2050. Increased employment contributes more to
	the fiscal improvement than the reduction in pension expenditures.
	However, these changes are basically level effects; the reform has
	a surprisingly small effect on the growth rate of the necessary tax
	burden starting in 2020. In particular, the growth rate of public
	pension expenditures is hardly affected. Stronger government
	finances and higher employment is obtained at the expense of a
	significant increase income inequality among old age pensioners.

Keywords: Factor demand; technological changes; growth rates
Classification-JEL: C32; C52; D24
Abstract: In a system with n input factors there are n &#8722; 1
	independent cost shares. An often-used approach in estimating
	factor demand systems is to (implicitly or explicitly) assume that
	there is a (independent) cointegrating relationship for each of the
	n &#8722; 1 independent cost shares. However, due to technological
	changes there might not be as many cointegrating relationships as
	there are (independent) cost shares. The paper presents a flexible
	demand system that allows for both factor neutral technological
	changes as well as technological changes that affect the relative
	use of the different factors. The empirical tests indicate that
	there are fewer cointegrating relationships than usually implied by
	using conventional estimation approaches. This result is consistent
	with technological changes. I argue that since such unexplained
	technological changes are likely to affect input factor decisions,
	a demand system that allows for such changes should be preferred.

Abstract: The European competition rules restrict governments’ opportunity
	to differentiate terms of energy accessibility among firms and
	industries. This easily runs counter with regional and industrial
	goals of national energy policies. Norway levies a tax on use of
	electricity, but exempts main industrial usages. This analysis
	assesses alternative, internationally legal, designs of the system
	in terms of their effects on efficiency and distribution, including
	industrial objectives. Among the reforms we explore, removing the
	exemptions would be the most effective way of raising revenue, but
	it would be politically costly by deteriorating the competitiveness
	of today's favoured industries. An entire abolishment of the
	electricity tax, and replacing revenue by increased VAT, would
	generate a more equal distribution of standard of living and, at
	the same time, avoid the trade-off between efficiency and
	competitiveness.

Abstract: This descriptive study discusses the effects of increases in
	domestic gas prices on the Russian gas market. Domestic natural gas
	prices have remained below their long-run marginal cost for more
	than a decade since Russia’s movement toward a market economy in
	1991. As a result, the ability of the Russian gas sector to meet
	future growing demand from domestic and foreign consumers has come
	under question. In an attempt to avoid gas shortages in the future,
	Russian government wishes to introduce netback pricing of natural
	gas after 2011. Netback pricing refers to the process of equalizing
	the gas price in Russia to the gas price in Europe after adjusting
	for export taxes, transportation costs, and transit tariffs. The
	paper concludes that netback pricing can help Russia to avoid a gas
	deficit. However, the gas supply in Russia will remain tight until
	2011. The downside of netback pricing is that it increases the
	ability of Gazprom to strengthen its control over the Russian gas
	industry.

Abstract: This paper assesses whether a parsimonious partial equilibrium
	job search model with on-the-job search can reproduce observed job
	durations and transitions to other jobs and to nonemployment. We
	allow for unobserved heterogeneity across individuals in key
	structural parameters. Observed heterogeneity and life cycle
	effects are accounted for by estimating separate models for flow
	samples of labor market entrants and stock samples of “mature”
	workers with 10-11 years of experience, by stratifying on education
	length and by allowing for non-search related wage growth due to
	accumulation of labor market experience. We use comparable register
	based panel data for two countries, Denmark and Norway. All workers
	are followed for 6 years. The model fits observed job-to-job and
	job-to-nonemployment hazard functions well for most samples with a
	better fit for entrants than for mature workers, especially for the
	job-to-job hazard function. We find important differences in
	structural parameters between entrants and mature workers and we
	find that the Norwegian labor market is more frictional than the
	Danish labor market.

Classification-JEL: D31; H72; I30
Abstract: Despite a broad consensus on the need to account for the value of
	public services and geographical cost of living differences on the
	measurement of poverty, there is little reliable evidence on how
	these factors actually affect poverty estimates. Unlike the
	standard approach in studies of the distribution of public
	services, this paper employs a method for valuing sector-specific
	local public services that accounts for differences between
	municipalities in the costs and capacity to produce public
	services. Furthermore, recipient frequencies in various demographic
	groups are used as the basis for determining the allocation of the
	value of these services on citizens of the municipalities.
	Geographical differences in living costs are accounted for by using
	municipal housing price indices or by replacing the
	country-specific poverty line with municipal-specific poverty
	lines. Applying Norwegian register data for the period 1993-2001,
	we find that disregarding the value of local public services and
	geographic cost of living differences yields a misleading picture
	of poverty.

Classification-JEL: J22; C51
Abstract: Traditional labor supply analysis is based on the assumption that
	workers only have preferences over consumption and hours of work,
	and are able to choose consumption and hours freely within the
	budget constraint. Recently, various discrete choice versions of
	the traditional approach (with discrete hours) have become popular,
	but the basic assumption above is still maintained. Neither of
	these two approaches allows for agents’preferences over qualitative
	job-specific or choice restrictions facing the agents in the labor
	market in terms of restricted choice sets of job opportunities. In
	this paper we argue for an alternative modeling framework that
	differs from the standard models of labor supply in that the notion
	of job choice is fundamental. Specifically, the worker is assumed
	to have preferences over a latent worker-specific choice set of
	jobs from which he chooses his preferred job. A job is
	characterized with fixed (job-specific) working hours, wage rate
	and non-pecuniary attributes. As a result, observed hours of work
	and wage rate are interpreted as the job-specific (fixed) hours of
	work and wage rate associated with the chosen job. The discussion
	in this paper focuses on interpretation of different versions and
	extensions of the alternative framework, theoretical and practical
	advantages, and how this approach relates to familiar existing
	approaches in the literature.

Classification-JEL:  
Abstract: Over the last few decades, several instruments have evolved to
	deal with similar energy and environmental challenges. For
	instance, the economic literature prescribes separate tax or
	cap-and-trade systems to internalize negative environmental
	externalities and subsidies to internalize positive externalities
	such as R&D. However, policy is not straightforward because of the
	influence on cost and competition and concerns for regional
	employment, economic activity within certain industries, and any
	distributional effects. Tax discrimination, subsidies and
	regulations then undermine the efficiency of energy instruments. To
	balance any environmental concerns, other instruments, including
	green and white certificates, have been created. While innovative,
	these work as simple combinations of taxes and subsidies. While the
	extant literature thoroughly analyzes the partial effects of these
	instruments, there has been little focus on their basics and the
	effects of aggregate taxes and subsidies. This complexity calls for
	research on the efficiency of each instrument, including the
	administration and transaction costs associated with holding a
	large set of instruments. We should consider the coordination and
	simplification of policy tools before complicating the system
	further by introducing new, primarily equivalent, instruments.

Keywords: Climate policy; technological change; emission tax
Classification-JEL: Q28; D21; C68
Abstract: Many European politicians argue that since technological
	development is needed to solve the climate problem, the EU should
	take the lead and set tougher emission targets than what is
	required by the Kyoto protocol. Moreover, emission trading with
	other countries outside EU should be limited so as to keep emission
	quota prices high. However, the policy of spurring R&D by setting
	high emission taxes today is not suggested by the literature on
	climate change and R&D. In this paper we investigate this result
	further by modeling innovation activity explicitly. In our model
	both the amount of R&D and the amount of CO2 abatement are decided
	in a decentralized way by the market as a response to an emission
	tax. Moreover, we introduce three distinct failures in the market
	for new innovations; monopolistic pricing behavior, insufficient
	patent protection and dynamic knowledge spillovers. Our findings
	suggest that governments should under some circumstances set a
	higher carbon tax today if we have technological change driven by
	R&D than if we have pure exogenous technological change. Based on
	numerical simulations these circumstances are i) "a standing on
	shoulders" type of externality in R&D or ii) weak patent
	protection.

Classification-JEL: H21; Q28
Abstract: Allocation of free emissions allowances may distort firms'
	incentives or have adverse distributional effects. Nevertheless,
	Böhringer and Lange (2005) show that in a closed emissions trading
	scheme with a fixed number of firms, a first-best outcome can be
	achieved if the base year for allocation is continually updated
	(i.e. updated grandfathering). In this paper we examine whether
	updated grandfathering alters the entry and exit conditions for
	firms compared to pure grandfathering, and how the distributional
	effects are affected. We find that updated grandfathering functions
	surprisingly similar to pure grandfathering: First, the incentives
	to entry and exit are identical under the two regimes. Second, the
	total value of free quotas to existing firms, based on emissions
	before the system starts, is identical under pure and updated
	grandfathering. In both cases, higher prices under updated
	grandfathering exactly match the shorter time period with free
	allowances. The only difference occurs when there is some
	combination of auction and pure or updated grandfathering, in which
	case the total value of free quotas will always be highest under
	pure grandfathering. Entry and exit incentives are still the same.

Keywords: oil market; tax revenue; equilibrium model
Classification-JEL: H21; Q31; Q38
Abstract: Using a partial equilibrium model for the global oil market, we
	search for the producer tax that maximizes the government’s
	discounted tax revenue in Norway. The oil market model explicitly
	accounts for reserves, development and production in 4 field
	categories across 15 regions. The oil companies optimize their
	profit and we study how different tax rates influence their
	investment and production profiles over time. Our results show that
	a net tax rate in the range of 83 to 87 percent gives the highest
	tax revenue over a wide range of oil prices and government’s
	discount rates. However, to avoid premature policy recommendations
	based on assumptions that are more or less uncertain, we carry out
	various sensitivity analysis in the favor of lower taxes. These
	analysis show that it is generally never optimal to reduce the
	prevailing net tax rate of 78 percent. Only in a very pessimistic
	scenario regarding costs and exploration is it optimal with a minor
	reduction in the tax rate. Hence, even if many regard Norway as a
	high tax province, a robust conclusion seem to be that reducing the
	present tax level on oil production will not boost investment and
	production to such a degree that discounted tax revenue increases.
	We emphasize that such a conclusion holds whether the oil companies
	are constrained by credit or not.

Abstract: Employers cannot always displace workers at their own discretion.
	In many countries, Employment Protection Legislation (EPL) includes

	differ from the rules that apply for individual dismissal, to
	displace workers selectively. We investigate empirically whether
	workers with low expected productivity relative to co-workers face
	particularly high exit risks when establishments downsize. Our
	evidence is consistent with establishments using downsizings as a
	sorting device to terminate the employment of the least profitable
	workers who are protected against dismissal under normal times of
	operation. However, only a minor share of the displacements in
	downsizings may be attributed to opportunistic sorting by
	employers, suggesting that EPL may not be an important obstacle to
	firms’ firing of individual workers.

	tilted importance sampling, is introduced. A number of applications
	and Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate the power and applicability
	of the methods. As an example, simulated maximum likelihood
	estimates from the infamous salamander mating model from McCullagh
	and Nelder (1989) can be found to easily satisfactory precision
	with an importance sample size of 100.

	implies a hybrid emission control scheme where EU member states
	must apply complementary domestic emissions regulation for the
	non-trading sectors of their economies in order to comply with
	their national emission reduction targets. The EU ETS thus opens up
	for strategic partitioning of national emissions budgets by the
	member states between trading and non-trading sectors. In this
	paper we examine the potential effects of such strategic behavior
	on compliance cost and emissions prices. We show that concerns on
	efficiency losses from strategic partitioning are misplaced if all
	the member states behave in a Nash-Cournot manner. However, if a
	single country takes the official partitioning of the other
	countries as a reference point, there is substantial scope for
	exploiting market power.

Keywords: Temporal aggregation; Consumer demand; Heterogeneity
Classification-JEL: C43; D1
Abstract: Differences in estimated parameters depending on the frequency of
	aggregate data have been reported in several fields of economic
	research. Some differences are due to seasonal variations in
	demand, but temporal aggregation bias is reported even in
	seasonally adjusted models. These biases have been explained by
	time-nonseparable preferences and excluded dynamic components. We
	show that it is possible to observe temporal aggregation bias in a
	seasonally adjusted static model even when preferences are
	time-separable. This is because of changes in the distribution of
	exogenous factors describing the variation in seasonal demand
	across consumers. To show this, we develop a method for aggregation
	based on an Almost Ideal Demand System, where demand response
	varies across both consumers and time

Classification-JEL: E62; H31; O38; Q55
Abstract: This paper studies the timing of subsidies for environmental
	research and development (R&D) and how innovation policy is
	influenced by the costs of emissions. We use a dynamic computable
	general equilibrium (CGE) model with both general R&D and specific
	environmental R&D. We find two results that are important when
	subsidizing environmental R&D in order to target inefficiencies in
	the research markets. Firstly, the welfare gain from subsidies is
	larger when the costs of emissions are higher. This is because a
	high carbon tax increases the social (efficient) investment in
	environmental R&D, in excess of the private investment in R&D.
	Secondly, the welfare gain is greater when there is a falling time
	profile of the rate of subsidies for environmental R&D, rather than
	a constant or increasing profile. The reason is that the innovation
	externalities are larger in early periods.

Keywords: Performance related pay; wage inequality; union bargaining
Classification-JEL: J31; J33
Abstract: This paper examines the impact of performance-related pay on wage
	differentials within firms. Our theoretical framework predicts
	that, compared to a fixed pay system, pay schemes based on
	individual effort increase within-firm wage inequality, while
	group-based bonuses have minor effects on wage dispersion. Theory
	also predicts an interaction between performance-related pay and
	union bargaining, where union power reduces the impact of
	performance pay on wage dispersion. The empirical contribution
	utilizes two recent Norwegian employer surveys, linked to a full
	set of employee records. A longitudinal sub-sample allows for
	identification based on fixed establishment effects. Introduction
	of performance-related pay is shown to raise residual wage
	inequality in nonunion firms, but not in firms with high union
	density. Our findings suggest that even though performance-related
	pay appears to be on the rise, the overall impact on wage
	dispersion is likely to be small, particularly in European
	countries with strong unions.

Abstract: This paper studies the effect of a CDM tree-planting project on

	taking economy-wide impacts into account. Carbon sequestration in
	agricultural soil is considered in addition to the carbon in the
	tree farm itself. The study points to that project designs that
	raise the general investment level may add substantially to the
	project's carbon capture by stimulating the productivity of
	agriculture, thus binding more carbon in soil. As demand for crops
	is rising, the mode of agricultural production turns more intensive
	and improved plant growth leaves more plant residues for uptake as
	soil organic carbon. As for the income effect, the non-poor benefit
	more than the poor in economic terms, except when the project is
	hosted by the rural poorest. Foreign owned projects withdrawing the
	project surplus may turn out to reduce the income of urban poor and
	does not enhance agricultural productivity and beyond-project
	carbon sequestration.

Classification-JEL: C23; I32; I38; J00
Abstract: The generous Nordic model of welfare is commonly viewed as an
	exceptional success both in terms of equality and economic growth.
	However, it has recently become evident that subgroups of the
	population with weak labour market attachment and high welfare
	dependency, such as lone mothers, were vastly overrepresented among
	the poor. This motivated a workfare reform of the Norwegian welfare
	system for lone mothers; activity requirements were introduced,
	time limits imposed, and benefit levels raised. To evaluate the
	welfare reform we introduce an estimator that, unlike the much used
	difference-in-difference approach, accounts for the fact that
	policy changes are typically phased in gradually rather than coming
	into full effect at once. We find that the workfare reform did not
	only increase earnings and education as well as lower welfare
	caseloads and by this route ease the financial burden of the
	government, but also reduced poverty.

	means of bootstrapping. However, one obtains rather similar
	estimates of the standard errors of the Engel elasticities no

Classification-JEL: D43; Q54
Abstract: The literature suggests that Russia and Ukraine may become large
	sellers of greenhouse gas emissions permits under the Kyoto
	Protocol and might exploit their market power to maximize trading
	profits. The EU countries taken together will probably be net
	buyers of permits. For any given global target for emission,
	participation by developing countries with low-cost abatement
	options would benefit the net buyers of permits because the market
	price for carbon permits would go down. We explore how the EU could
	benefit from a broader participation through specific bilateral
	agreements with developing countries in the post-Kyoto period. The
	bilateral agreement involves a minimum permit sales requirement
	which is compensated by a financial transfer from EU to the
	developing country. Such bilateral agreement enables the EU to act
	strategically in the permit market on behalf of its member states,
	although firms in each member state are assumed to be price takers
	in the permit market. In a numerical simulation we show that an
	appropriately designed bilateral agreement between the EU and China
	can cut EU’s total compliance cost by one third.

	growth than those that remained in self-employment or as a closely

Abstract: All participants in power exchanges are interested in market
	responses when electricity prices change because this influences
	the profitability of actions. Contrary to most econometric work in
	this field, which uses annual time series or panel data, we exploit
	high-frequency data from a power exchange to estimate the spot
	price elasticities of the total market and of different market
	segments. The use of such data requires a simultaneous market model
	including both behavioral and control variables to capture
	short-term shifts in both demand and supply. Compared with Wolfram
	(1999) our short-term responses to spot market prices are not
	straightforward because the picture is confused by differences in
	production flexibilities in a complex and heterogeneous supply
	side, demand technologies and a combination of different end-user
	contracts. We show that short- and long-run price effects on demand
	differ significantly among hours, weekdays, seasons, and countries.

Abstract: Climate change impacts in the Arctic require that complex

	While traditional approaches to economic valuation may not be
	sufficient to capture these relationships, the research area of
	ecological economics suggests broader approaches to environmental
	uncertainties, taking into account ethical values and conflicts of
	interest. Increased activity in petroleum exploration,
	manufacturing, transportation, tourism and other services have the
	potential to alter the Arctic environment and societies
	considerably. Application of the precautionary principle is
	suggested as a way to manage situations with large degrees of
	environmental uncertainty and potentially irreversible
	consequences. Precautionary approaches require the development of
	processes for acknowledgement of uncertainties, facilitation of
	stakeholder participation, recognition of ethical values, and
	taking into account the traditional ecological knowledge of
	indigenous people of the Arctic. Combining traditional and
	scientific knowledge about nature is an important part of
	understanding the resilience capacity of ecological and social
	systems, and of enhancing the potential for sustainable

	regions. Using both a general theoretical approach and a numerical
	model of the global natural gas market, we demonstrate that the
	price effect from transport cost reductions depend on the relative
	distances between regional markets, the choice of transport
	technology, and supply and demand responsiveness in the different
	markets. Our numerical results suggest that European consumers
	would generally be better off if pipeline costs are reduced, while

Abstract: During the last decades Norwegian exporters have ƒ{ despite
	various forms of exchange rate targeting ƒ{ faced a rather volatile
	exchange rate which may have influenced their behaviour. Recently,
	the shift to inflation targeting and a freely floating exchange
	rate has brought about an even more volatile exchange rate. We
	examine the causal link between export performance and exchange
	rate volatility across different monetary policy regimes within the
	cointegrated VAR framework using the implied conditional variance
	from a GARCH model as a measure of volatility. Although treating
	the volatility measure as either a stationary or a non-stationary
	variable in the VAR, we are not able to find any evidence
	suggesting that export performance has been significantly affected
	by exchange rate uncertainty. We find, however, that volatility
	changes proxied by blip dummies related to the monetary policy
	change from a fixed to a managed floating exchange rate and the
	Asian financial crises during the 1990s enter significantly in a
	dynamic model for export growth ƒ{ in which the level of relative
	prices and world market demand together with the level of exports
	constitute a significant cointegration relationship. A forecasting
	exercise on the dynamic model rejects the hypothesis that increased
	exchange rate volatility in the wake of inflation targeting in the
	monetary policy has had a significant impact on export performance.

Abstract: The clean development mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol may induce

	accept a (generous) cap on their own emissions, allow domestic
	producers to invest in new efficient technologies, and sell the
	excess emission permits on the international permit market. The
	purpose of this article is to show how the gains from investment,
	and hence the incentive to invest in new technology in developing
	countries, differ between the two alternative regimes. We show that
	the difference in the gains from investment depends on whether the
	producers in developing countries face competitive or
	noncompetitive output markets, whether the investment affects fixed
	or variable production costs, and whether producers can reduce
	emissions through means other than investing in new technology.

	process by means of survival analysis and multivariate hazard rate
	regression. Second, we address the question of programme effects
	adopting a quasi-experimental design based on propensity score

	only when work is defined fairly broadly. However, the impact
	varies by target group. For immigrants and single mothers, there is
	no impact whether we use a strict or less strict definition of
	work. For youth, the effect is even estimated to be negative,
	implying that they would have been better off without this
	initiative. The only significant effect in the desired direction is
	found among other long-term social security recipients, and applies
	for both the strict and less strict definition of employment.
	Moreover, this effect is fairly large.

Abstract: Aggregation of tangible capital assets across vintages and
	decomposition of value aggregates into quantities and prices are
	considered. Focus is on both capital stock values and capital
	service values. If the definitions and ways of measuring prices and
	quantities are not conformable, a third component, denoted a
	quality component, may have to be included as a buffer. Should it
	then be suppressed by allocating it to either of the price and
	quantity components, or should quality be accounted for separately?
	In discussing these issues, five quantity variables and five price
	variables are involved. Some of them are observable from market
	data without large efforts, some are essentially unobservable, and
	some can be quantified only if certain (often non-testable)
	assumptions are made. Illustrations based on parametric functions
	are given.

Classification-JEL: I20; J63; J65
Abstract: Using Norwegian register data we estimate how children’s school
	performance is affected by their parents’ exposure to plant
	closure. Fathers’ exposure leads to a substantial decline in
	children’s graduation-year grade point average, but only in
	municipalities with mediocre-performing job markets. The negative
	effect does not appear to be driven by a reduction in father’s
	income and employment, an increase in parental divorce, or the
	trauma of relocating. In contrast, mothers’ exposure leads to
	improved school performance. Our findings appear to be consistent
	with sociological “role theories,” with parents unable to fully
	shield their children from the stress caused by threats to the
	father’s traditional role as breadwinner, and mothers responding to
	job loss by allocating greater attention towards child rearing.

Abstract: The density of fuel filling stations influences consumers'
	utility of private car transport. Thus, to the extent that
	different modes of private transport require different fuels, there
	may exist a network externality in the consumption of private
	transport. We investigate this in a formal model of the market for
	private transport. In the model there are two competing
	technologies; today's internal combustion engine based on fossil
	fuels, and tomorrow's hydrogen car. Due to the network externality
	there may exist several market equilibriums, of which one is likely
	to Pareto dominate the other(s). Thus, a lock-in situation is
	possible. On the other hand, if either the costs of establishing
	hydrogen filling stations is too high or the hydrogen car
	technology is still in its infancy, the only equilibrium is the
	current internal combustion engine equilibrium. Hence, apart from
	internalizing the environmental externality on gasoline cars, the
	government has no reasons to intervene before the technology is
	ripe. And even then, governments should take great care so as not
	to create a situation of excess momentum.

Classification-JEL: H53; H55; D31; J22
Abstract: Any contribution to a pay-as-you-go pension system may be
	considered mandatory savings to the extent that it gives a claim to
	a future benefit. Contributors to the economic literature have
	argued that an increase in this savings component will lower
	implicit marginal tax rates, thereby reducing distortions in the
	labour market. However, the efficiency gain created by increasing
	the actuarial component of pensions may come at the cost of
	increased inequality in pension benefits. The trade-off between
	efficiency and equity is not easy to quantify in actual public
	pension schemes whose benefit functions intrinsically exhibit
	non-linear characteristics. This paper develops a framework to
	quantify this trade-off in a fully specified pension system using
	dynamic micro-simulation modelling. The methodology is then applied
	to five different pension schemes actually proposed for Norway. The
	results demonstrate the relevance of this study: The improvement of
	the equity-efficiency trade-off either does not materialise, as in
	one case, or is arguably driven by a different factor than
	advocated by policymakers.

Classification-JEL: J12; J63; J65
Abstract: We estimate the effect of plant closure on divorce using a panel
	data set comprising more than 80,000 married couples in Norway.
	Plant closure substantially increases the likelihood of marital
	dissolution of workers in affected plants. The marriages of
	husbands originally employed in plants that closed between 1995 and
	2000 were 11 percent more likely to be dissolved by 2003 than
	comparable marriages of husbands in stable plants. Additional
	analyses suggest that the effect of plant closure on divorce is not
	due to unexpected reduction in earnings. The results are, however,
	consistent with role theories, in which the husband’s
	attractiveness declines if he fails to fulfill a traditional role
	as a breadwinner.

Abstract: Many countries spend significant resources on investment
	promotion agencies (IPAs) in the hope of attracting inflows of
	foreign direct investment (FDI). Despite the importance of this
	question for public policy choices, little is known about the
	effectiveness of investment promotion efforts. This study uses
	newly collected data on national IPAs in 109 countries to examine
	the effects of investment promotion on FDI inflows. The empirical
	analysis follows two approaches. First, we test whether sectors
	explicitly targeted by IPAs receive more FDI in the post-targeting
	period relative to the pre-targeting period and non-targeted
	sectors. Second, we examine whether the existence of an IPA is
	correlated with higher FDI inflows. Results from both approaches
	point to the same conclusion. Investment promotion efforts appear
	to increase FDI inflows to developing countries. Moreover, agency
	characteristics, such as its legal status and reporting structure,
	affect the effectiveness of investment promotion. There is also
	evidence of FDI diversion due to investment incentives offered by
	other countries in the same geographic region.

Abstract: Recent decades have been characterized by rapid technological
	change. In the same period, early withdrawal from the labor market
	has increased markedly. One particular question concerns the
	effects of technological change and organizational change on the
	labor market participation of workers of different ages. The
	question posed in this paper is whether technological change and
	organizational change are biased against age, thereby causing a
	shift in demand from older to younger workers. We estimate the
	effects of organizational change and technological change on wage
	bill shares for five age groups. By using panel data, we control
	for unobserved firm fixed effects. The results indicate that
	organizational change raises the wage bill share for workers in
	their forties but lowers the share for workers in their fifties.
	The wage bill shares of the youngest and oldest workers are hardly
	affected by organizational change and technological change.
	Separate estimates for men and women yield qualitatively similar
	results. In regressions for different educational levels, wage bill
	shares are positively affected by organizational change for highly
	educated individuals in their thirties. Technological change
	increases the wage bill share of highly educated workers in their
	sixties. For workers with intermediate and lower levels of
	education, the results are similar to those obtained from the whole
	sample.

Abstract: Increased focus on shareholder returns, capital discipline and
	return on capital employed (RoACE) caused a slowdown in investment
	rates and production growth among international oil companies
	around the turn of the century. Focusing on supply side dynamics of
	the oil market, we explore a hypothesis that the restructuring in
	the international oil industry towards the end of the 1990s had
	long-lived effects on OPEC strategies – and on oil price formation.
	Based on a partial equilibrium model for the global oil market, we
	examine the effects of the industry restructuring on oil supply and
	oil prices, compared with a counterfactual reference scenario
	characterised by industrial stability and unchanged price ambitions
	within OPEC. A key result is that important factors behind the
	currently high oil price can be traced back to the industrial
	restructuring and to the Asian economic crisis. This suggests that
	temporary economic and financial shocks may have a long-term impact
	on oil price formation.

Abstract: We explore how innovation incentives in a small, open economy
	should be designed in order to achieve the highest welfare and
	growth, by means of a computable general equilibrium model with
	R&D-driven endogenous technological change embodied in varieties of
	capital. We study policy alternatives targeted towards R&D, capital
	varieties formation, and domestic investments in capital varieties.
	Subsidising domestic investments, thereby excluding stimuli to
	world market deliveries, generates less R&D, capital formation,
	economic growth, and welfare, than do the other alternatives,
	reflecting that the domestic market for capital varieties is
	limited. Directing support to R&D rather than to capital formation
	generates stronger economic growth, a higher number of patents and
	capital varieties, and a higher share of R&D in total production.
	However, it costs in terms of lower production within each firm,
	where presence of sunk patent costs and mark-ups result in
	efficiency losses. The welfare result is, thus, slightly lower.

Keywords: Technological changes; early retirement
Classification-JEL:  
Abstract: Older workers typically possess older vintages of skills than
	younger workers, and they may suffer more from technological
	change. Experienced workers may nevertheless have accumulated human
	capital making them suitable for adopting new technologies. On the
	other hand, to adjust to new technologies, workers must invest in
	training. This may not be worthwhile for the oldest workers, and
	technological change may thus induce early retirement. If
	technological change occurs often, workers will continuously invest
	in training, which may insulate them from the negative effect of
	technological change. We exploit the approach by Bartel and
	Sicherman (1993) to identify this effect by estimating the
	retirement response to technological change. We examine two
	hypotheses about the effects of technological changes on early
	retirement for workers from the age of 50 to the mandatory age of
	retirement at 67. First, we examine whether workers in firms with
	higher rates of anticipated technological change retire later than
	workers in firms with lower rates of technological change. Second,
	we examine if unanticipated technological change is positively
	correlated with earlier retirement. We use a matched
	employer-employee data set with a rich set of controls for worker,
	firm and local labour market characteristics, and firm level
	measures of anticipated and not-anticipated technological change.
	We find a negative correlation between early retirement and
	anticipated technological change only for the oldest male workers
	(62 to 66). Further, we find a higher probability of transition to
	retirement for workers above 60 for firms introducing new process
	technologies.

Keywords: Pupil achievement; school resources
Classification-JEL: I21; I28; J24
Abstract: Despite important policy implications associated with the
	allocation of education resources, evidence on the effectiveness of
	school inputs remains inconclusive. In part, this is due to
	endogenous allocation; families sort themselves non-randomly into
	school districts and school districts allocate money based in order
	to compensate (or reinforce) differences in child abilities, which
	leaves estimates of school input effects likely to be biased. Using
	variation in education expenditures induced by the location of
	natural resources in Norway, we examine the effect of school
	resources on pupil outcomes. We find that higher school
	expenditures, triggered by higher revenues from local taxes on
	hydropower plants, have a significantly positive effect on pupil
	performance at age 16. The IV estimates contrast with the standard
	cross-sectional estimates that reveal no effects of extra
	resources.

Abstract: This paper investigates household purchasing behavior in response

	undermine the pursuit of important health and social policy goals.
	We match novel supermarket scanner and consumer expenditure data to
	measure the size and scope of the effect for households and stores.
	We find that stores near/far from the international border have
	statistically significantly lower/higher sales of beer and tobacco
	than comparable stores far/near the border. Moreover, we find that
	households near the border report higher consumption of these same
	goods. This is consistent with households facing lower prices.
	Finally, we find measures of externalities associated with the
	consumption of alcohol and tobacco are higher near the border.

Abstract: The question of whether the housing market is efficient or not is
	posed by an increasing number of economists, policymakers, current
	homeowners and prospective homebuyers. This article tests the
	efficiency hypothesis on data from the Norwegian housing market in
	its capital, Oslo. We employ the Case-Shiller time-persistence-test
	on a repeated-sales model of a house price index and returns to
	housing. Our data cover the period 1991-2002 and comprise 20 752
	transactions of same-object-repeated-sales. We explain why certain
	features, sometimes suppressed in earlier tests, of the data set
	are of importance in efficiency tests, and argue that ours is
	particularly well-suited for the purpose. We demonstrate that the
	repeated-sales house price index contains inertia and
	time-persistence. In addition, we investigate how the price history
	of returns; which consist of capital gains, dividends, and interest
	payments; can be exploited to predict future returns. Both the
	house price index and housing returns contain forecastable
	elements, so we reject the null hypothesis of martingale processes,
	a finding that is indicative of Case-Shiller inefficiency. This
	discovery is supplemented with an exploration of trading and timing
	rules by examinations of intra-market and inter-market returns. We
	show that the housing market consistently yield higher return at
	lower risk than does the stock market over the period, which is
	inconsistent with inter-market efficiency.

Abstract: The market power of firms in intermediate good markets is found

	intermediate good firms contributes to increase the wedge between
	the marginal product of labor and the wage rate received by
	workers, as intermediate good firms add additional markups to the
	unit cost of a consumer good. This creates an additional wedge in
	the labor market, and is costly due to the existing substantial tax
	wedge in the labor market. The welfare cost of distortions in the
	supply of labor created by market power of firms is found to be
	more than 40 times larger than the welfare cost of distortions in
	the allocation of consumer goods created by differences in market
	power of firms. This welfare cost is substantial compared to

Abstract: Norway adopted a flexible inflation target in March 2001
	following a long period with exchange rate targeting in various
	forms. The regime shift reverses the causal ordering between
	changes in the nominal exchange rate and changes in the interest
	rate. When the central bank targets the exchange rate, interest
	rates are rarely changed independently of foreign interest rates
	and only to counteract large movements in the exchange rate after
	interventions have failed to stabilise the exchange rate. With
	inflation targeting the interest rate is used to stabilise the

Abstract: Recently, several authors have questioned the evidence claimed by
	Galí and Gertler (1999) and Galí, Gertler and López-Salido (2001)
	that a hybrid version of the New Keynesian Phillips Curve
	approximates European and US inflation dynamics quite well. We
	re-examine the evidence using likelihood-based methods. Although
	including lagged inflation enhances the empirical fit, the
	improvement is not large enough to yield a model that passes a
	likelihood ratio test. We also show that the likelihood surface is
	rather flat, especially in the European case, indicating that the
	model may be weakly identified as criticised by others using
	alternative methods.

Keywords: Fiscal sustainability; long run projections; discounting
Classification-JEL: H30; H55; H62
Abstract: Assessments of fiscal sustainability (FS) problems should be
	based on present values of government revenues and expenditures
	over an infinite horizon. The paper shows that realistic
	assumptions imply that the growth rate of government expenditure
	components may exceed both the steady state growth rate of the
	economy and the relevant discount rate, which makes the FS problem
	immeasurably large. The common practice of ad hoc exogenous
	alignment of government expenditures to the steady state growth
	path after some distant year may significantly diminish the FS
	problem, since the effective discounting is likely to remain low.
	Low effective discounting also makes the FS assessment highly
	non-robust, reducing its political relevance. It suggests that the
	fiscal sustainability should be improved by reducing the growth
	rates of government expenditures, a strategy followed in e.g. the
	Swedish pension reform.

Keywords: Income inequality; restricted interpersonal comparability;
	heterogeneity; real income comparison; regional price index;
	decomposition of inequality by income factors
Classification-JEL: D31; D33; D63; I30
Abstract: The standard approach in empirical analyses of income
	distributions is to estimate income inequality in a country under
	the assumption of full interpersonal comparability of income. To be
	meaningful, this method requires that prices and qualities of goods
	as well as consumption habits are uniform across individuals in
	different regions of the country. In this paper, we pursue two
	alternative approaches to measure inequality under restricted
	interpersonal comparability of income. First, we estimate regional
	price indices, transform observed incomes into real incomes in an
	attempt to incorporate relevant non-income heterogeneity, and then
	aggregate across individuals. Second, we use the observed income
	data and account for non-income heterogeneity at the aggregation
	stage. Results based on a Norwegian register household panel data
	set indicates that both levels and trends in overall inequality as
	well as the inequality contributions of various income factors are
	robust to whether the income inequality analysis is based on the
	standard approach or the methods developed to cope with
	comparability problems within a country.

Abstract: As an alternative to the conventional methods for measuring
	chronic poverty, this paper proposes an interpersonal comparable
	measure of permanent income as a basis for defining and measuring
	chronic poverty. This approach accounts for the fact that
	individuals regularly undertake inter-period income transfers.
	Moreover, the approach allows for individual-specific interest
	rates on borrowing and saving as well as for the presence of
	liquidity constraints. Due to the general nature the proposed
	method proves useful for evaluating the theoretical basis of the
	standard methods for measuring chronic poverty.

Classification-JEL: H55; I12; I38; J63; J65
Abstract: We estimate the magnitude of social interaction effects in
	disability pension participation among older workers in Norway.
	Specifically, we investigate how a worker’s propensity to draw
	disability benefits is affected by a plausibly exogenous shock to
	the disability entry rate of similarly-aged workers in his or her
	neighborhood. The problem of omitted variable bias is addressed by
	employing a novel instrumental variable (IV) strategy, using plant
	downsizing at neighbors’ plants of employment as an instrument for
	the disability entry rate among one’s previously employed
	neighbors. Our IV estimates suggest that a one percentage point
	increase in the participation rate of previously employed neighbors
	increased the subsequent 4-year entry rate of workers by about
	one-half a percentage point. Numerous robustness and specification
	tests appear to support the validity of the identifying assumption
	in our IV strategy.

Keywords: Emission trading; Allocation of quotas; Quota prices.
Classification-JEL: H21; Q28
Abstract: Emission trading schemes where allocations are based on updated
	baseline emissions give firms less incentives to reduce emissions.
	Nevertheless, according to Böhringer and Lange (2005a), such
	allocation schemes are cost-effective if the system is closed and
	allocation rules are equal across firms. In this paper we show that
	the cost-effective solution may be infeasible if the marginal
	abatement costs grow too fast. Moreover, if a price cap or
	banking/borrowing are introduced, the abatement profile is no
	longer the same as in the case with lump sum allocation. In
	addition, we show that with allocation based on updated emissions,
	the quota price will always exceed the marginal abatement costs.
	Numerical simulations indicate that the quota price most likely
	will be several times higher than the marginal abatement costs,
	unless a significant share of allowances are either auctioned or
	lump sum distributed.

Keywords: Russia; Natural gas; export; monopoly; national welfare
Classification-JEL: D43; D60; L13; Q38
Abstract: Having exports from more than one Russian gas producer has been
	an important issue in the Russian–EU energy dialogue during the
	last decade. Nevertheless, in June 2006, Russian Federal law
	legalized the de facto export monopoly of Gazprom. Political and
	commercial interests have regularly explained the Russian strategy
	for the European gas market. However, it is important that economic
	efficiency is also taken into account. Economists often evaluate
	the efficiency of a policy through its effect on national welfare.
	In this paper, I examine both theoretically and numerically whether
	a liberalization of Russian gas exports would increase Russian
	national welfare, given that the Russian domestic market is already
	deregulated. The results of the paper show that the dominant
	position of Gazprom in the Russian gas industry might stimulate the
	government to support Gazprom's export monopoly. The market share
	of independent producers in the Russian gas market would have to be
	significantly increased for Russian export liberalization to be
	welfare enhancing.

Abstract: This paper addresses the impact of endogenous technology through

	timing of environmental policy. We develop two models, the first
	with technological change through R&D and the second with LbD. We
	study the interaction between environmental taxes and innovation
	externalities in a dynamic economy and prove policy equivalence
	between the second-best R&D and the LbD model. Our analysis shows
	that the difference found in the literature between optimal
	environmental policy in R&D and LbD models can partly be traced
	back to the set of policy instruments available, rather than being
	directly linked to the source of technological innovation.
	Arguments for early action in LbD models carry over to a
	second-best R&D setting. We show that environmental taxes should be
	high compared to the Pigouvian levels when an abatement industry is
	developing. We illustrate our analysis through numerical
	simulations on climate change policy.

Keywords: Tax incentives; credit rationing; mortgage market; household debt
Classification-JEL: D91; H20
Abstract: A number of European countries changed their tax system in the
	early 1990s along the lines of the US tax reform act of 1986. After
	the reforms marginal tax rates were generally lower, and mortgage
	interest deductions less generous. At the same time a long period
	of house appreciation started in most countries. This paper
	considers this puzzle empirically using a rich data base of
	Norwegian tax records from 1986 to 2000. We use nonparametric,
	difference in difference and tobit approaches in attempt to control
	for a wide array of factors that may offset, or mask, response to
	changed incentives. Of special concern is possible credit
	constrains as implied by credit score models routinely applied by
	credit institutions. We find a surprisingly static relationship
	between the probability of debt across age groups, and a strikingly
	linear and unchanged relationship between debt and gross income for
	young households. After the reform house prices doubled and
	tripled. The wealth effect may spur consumption. We find no sign of
	consumption smoothing by using self-owned housing as debt
	collateral, not even for older households. On the contrary, older
	households did react to the reform by reducing real debt.

	attractive properties as an alternative interpretation of the

	yield essential information on polarization in the population. The

Abstract: This paper discusses the construction and computation of a

	on the fraction of consumers that do not purchase a variant of the
	product. The method is applied to data on automobile demand in
	Norway from 1994 to 2002. Both the Laspeyres index and the index
	based on hedonic regression yield lower estimates of the pricees
	from 1999 to 2002 than does the quality adjusted price index. This
	is mainly due to variations in the fraction of persons who purchase

Classification-JEL: J22; C51
Abstract: This paper analyzes the properties of a particular sectoral labor
	supply model developed in Dagsvik and Strøm (2006). The model is
	estimated on labor supply data for married women in Norway 1994. In
	this model, workers have preferences over sectors and latent job
	attributes. Moreover, the model allows for a representation of the
	individual choice sets of feasible jobs in the economy. The
	properties of the model are explored by calculating elasticities
	and through simulations of the effects of particular tax reforms.
	The overall wage elasticities are rather small, but these small
	elasticities shadow for much stronger sectoral responses. An
	overall wage increase and, of course, a wage increase in the
	private sector only, gives women an incentive to shift their labor
	supply from the public to the private sector. Marginal tax rates
	were cut considerably in the 1992 tax reform. We find that the
	impact on overall labor supply is rather modest, but again these
	modest changes shadow for stronger sectoral changes. The tax reform
	stimulated the women to shift their labor from the public to the
	private sector and to work longer hours. A calculation of mean
	compensated variation shows that the richest households benefited
	far more from the 1992 tax reform than did the poorest households.

Keywords: Fiscal sustainability; productivity growth; general equilibrium

Abstract: The paper analyses the fiscal effects of productivity shifts in

	supply, it shows that productivity shifts in sectors producing
	non-traded goods (N-sector) are irrelevant for the tax rates
	necessary to meet the government budget constraint. Also
	productivity shifts in the traded goods sector (T-sector) have a
	neutral fiscal effect, provided that the wage dependency of the tax
	bases and government expenditures are equal. If the wage dependency
	of expenditures exceeds that of revenues, tax rates must be
	increased in order to restore the government budget constraint.
	Simulations on a CGE model of the Norwegian economy confirm the
	theoretical results, and demonstrate that productivty growth on
	balance has an adverse fiscal effect. Moreover, the necessary
	increase in the tax rates of a productivity improvement in the
	T-sector is three times as high as the corresponding effect of a
	comparable productivity shift in the N-sector.

Abstract: Genetically modified (GM) food has raised both health-risk fears

	voluntary labeling of GM-free food be at least as good as a trade
	ban? And, under what conditions can providing labels for GM-free
	food be protectionist? Our main finding is that the merits of a
	product labeling policy depend crucially on the way food products
	are differentiated. If they are poorly differentiated from the
	beginning, a labeling policy will probably not function as good as
	a trade ban does; while if they are already well differentiated, a
	labeling policy is likely the optimal policy for the importing
	country. Finally, as long as consumers' willingness to pay to avoid
	GM-food is high, a labeling policy is not protectionist. In fact,
	if products are poorly differentiated from the beginning, foreign
	firms will probably increase their profit even if they do not
	choose to label their products.

Abstract: Out of necessity, the earliest studies of immigrants' performance

	However, as the employment rates of women in Western countries rise
	and approach those of men, questions about the labor market
	adjustments of immigrant women also become increasingly relevant.
	Furthermore, studies of earnings assimilation have typically
	analyzed only those individuals actually employed (full-time) in
	the labor market. Hence, they are unable to provide valuable
	insights into the extent to which the participation rates of
	immigrants – men or women – increase over time in the host country.
	This study analyzes explicitly the extent to which non-Western
	immigrants – both men and women – enter the labor market in Norway.

Abstract: In light of the riots and unrest among immigrants in France
	during the fall of 2005, the question of how immigrants are faring
	with respect to a certain minimum in society is both a timely and
	pertinent question for a number of European countries. In Norway,
	the prevalence of poverty is alarmingly high among immigrants and
	stands in stark contrast to the very low poverty rates for the
	native Norwegian population. Thus, unless the high poverty rates in
	the immigrant population are just a temporary feature of the
	immigrants' initial period of adjustment in the host country,
	poverty among immigrants is a cause for concern in Norway, too.
	This paper wishes to serve as a complement or extension of previous
	studies of immigrant adjustment; the study also aims to provide
	insights on the substantial heterogeneity -- observed, unobserved
	and unobservable -- in the immigrant population in Norway.

Abstract: In this paper, we discuss aspects of a particular framework for
	modeling labor supply and the application of this approach in
	practical policy simulation experiments. This modeling framework
	differs from the standard models of labor supply in that the notion
	of job choice is fundamental. Specifically, the worker is assumed
	to have preferences over a latent worker-specific choice set of
	jobs from which he or she chooses his or her preferred job. A job
	is characterized with fixed (job-specific) working hours and other
	non-pecuniary attributes. As a result, observed hours of work are
	interpreted as the job-specific (fixed) hours of work that is
	associated with the chosen job. We then show that our framework is
	practical with respect to applications in empirical analysis and
	simulation experiments, and is able to produce satisfactory
	out-of-sample predictions by estimating the model on Norwegian
	microdata from 1997 and predicting the corresponding microdata from
	2003.

Abstract: In this paper we develop a framework for analyzing panel data
	with observations on rank ordered alternatives that allows for
	correlated random taste shifters across time and across
	alternatives. As a special case we obtain a nested logit model type
	for rank ordered alternatives. We have applied this framework to
	estimate several model versions for household demand for
	conventional and alternative fuel automobiles in Shanghai based on
	rank ordered data obtained from a stated preference survey. The
	preferred model is then used to calculate demand probabilities and
	elasticities and the willingness-to-pay for alternative fuel
	vehicles.

Abstract: In Norway there is a growing concern that electricity production
	and transmission may not meet the demand in peak-load situations.
	It is therefore important to evaluate the potential of different
	demand side measures that may contribute to reduce peak load. This
	paper analyses data from an experiment where residential water
	heaters were automatically disconnected during peak periods of the
	day. A model of hourly electricity consumption is used to evaluate
	the effects on the load of the disconnections. The results indicate
	an average consumption reduction per household of approximately 0.5
	kWh/h during disconnection, and an additional average increase in
	consumption the following hour, due to the payback effect, of
	approximately 0.2 kWh/h.

Abstract: Norway has a long history in trying to develop management tools

	usefulness of indices like “green GDP” to efforts of developing
	sustainable development indicators, experiences have been gained.
	The paper seeks to both describe the landscape and discussions
	associated with the key terms, and to communicate some lessons
	drawn from the Norwegian experiences. The conclusion focuses on the
	fact that whatever information is collected and organised to
	support the relevant decision-making processes, the final outcome
	should always be judged in terms of its impacts on policy
	processes. Thus, we issue a warning against large-scale development
	of information systems, without due regard to the final utilisation
	of the output.

Classification-JEL: D58; O11; Q25; Q28; Q48
Abstract: Pollution intensive production can be avoided domestically by
	increased imports and less exports of dirty products. Such trade
	effects may imply more emissions abroad, or pollution leakages. We
	study whether such leakages may contribute to the observed inverted
	relationship between emissions and economic growth - the
	Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC). In our case, the rich, open
	Norwegian economy, we find little evidence for the hypothesis that
	pollution leakages contribute to explain the EKC. Despite an
	observed decoupling of emissions from economic growth over the past
	20 years, there was no increase in pollution leakages over this
	period. Rather, emissions related to export increased far more than
	the foreign emissions embodied in import, implying reduced
	leakages. In future projections, we find a lower degree of
	decoupling than in the past, but no corresponding reductions in
	leakages. Instead, leakages increase. This conclusion is fairly
	invariant to assumptions about future climate policy.

Abstract: How much is a wildflower worth? Inspired by “The worth of a
	songbird” by Funtowicz and Ravetz (1994) we use the value of a
	wildflower as symbol of the complexity of evaluating environmental
	qualities and risks. We critically discuss the application of
	cost-benefit analysis in evaluating environmental impacts of
	adoption of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). We argue that
	cost-benefit analysis should be supplemented with other methods,
	such as processes for assessing uncertainty, accommodation of
	scientific disagreements, and integration of stakeholders’
	interests and perspectives. A more inclusive perspective is to
	develop precautionary approaches that recognize the
	multidimensional nature of environmental qualities and risks, such
	as irreplaceability, irreversibility, uncertainty and complexity.
	Precautionary approaches can contribute to develop a stronger
	environmental responsibility within the framework of rational
	self-interest.

Title: Designing Optimal Taxes with a Microeconometric Model of Household

Keywords: Labour supply; optimal taxation; random utility model;
	microsimulation
Classification-JEL: H21; H31; J22
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to present an exercise where we
	identify optimal income tax rules under the constraint of fixed tax
	revenue. To this end, we estimate a microeconomic model with 78
	parameters that capture heterogeneity in consumption-leisure
	preferences for singles and couples as well as in job opportunities
	across individuals based on Norwegian household data for 1994. The
	estimated model is for a given tax rule used to simulate the
	choices made by single individuals and couples. Those choices are
	therefore generated by preferences and opportunities that vary
	across the decision units. Differently from what is common in the
	literature, we do not rely on a priori theoretical optimal taxation
	results, but instead we identify optimal tax rules – within a class
	of 6-parameter piece-wise linear rules - by iteratively running the
	model until a given social welfare function attains its maximum
	under the constraint of keeping constant the total net tax revenue.
	We explore a variety of social welfare functions with differing
	degree of inequality aversion and also two alternative social
	welfare principles, namely equality of outcome and equality of
	opportunity. All the social welfare functions turn out to imply an
	average tax rate lower than the current 1994 one. Moreover, all the
	optimal rules imply – with respect to the current rule – lower
	marginal rates on low and/or average income levels and higher
	marginal rates on sufficiently high income levels. These results
	are partially at odds with the tax reforms that took place in many
	countries during the last decades. While those reforms embodied the
	idea of lowering average tax rates, the way to implement it has
	typically consisted in reducing the top marginal rates. Our results
	instead suggest to lower average tax rates by reducing marginal
	rates on low and average income levels and increasing marginal
	rates on very high income levels.

Abstract: Productivity measures ignoring environmental effects may give
	misleading information on total productivity growth. Further,
	business cycles in the form of capacity utilization may also
	significantly influence productivity measures. In this paper, we
	develop an overall Malmquist productivity index and decompose
	changing efficiency rates into a contribution from environmental
	factors, capacity utilization and other traditional factors. The
	capacity utilization element is a contribution to the literature in
	that it takes into account the capacity for producing negative
	externalities. We decompose the frontier movements into a
	contribution from traditional factors and environmental factors and
	apply the model to a micro data set for two Norwegian industries:
	the pulp and paper industry and the inorganic chemistry industry.
	We find frontier improvements over the period included in the
	analysis, while the distance to the frontier has increased.
	Capacity utilization increased over the period and contributed to
	an average approach to the frontier, while environmental indicators
	contributed negatively. Analysis of the two industries indicates
	that differences between the traditional and revised efficiency
	measures changes are ambiguous, except from the capacity
	utilization element. This indicates that the environment loses when
	business cycles improve.

Classification-JEL: C61; D41; Q41
Abstract: In 2002/2003, the Nordic hydro-dominated power market faced a
	short-term supply shock. In autumn, precipitation and inflow were
	unusually low. As a result, there were record high prices in the
	following winter. Questions were raised whether the deregulated
	market creates sufficient incentives to invest in new production
	and transmission capacity to secure supply when overall inflow
	fails. One fear is that the market could break down when
	precipitation and inflow fails during the whole year, which is more
	probable than a short-term extreme inflow failure. We apply a
	market model to simulate the market effects with two events: i) an
	overall inflow shortage 25 per cent lower than normal, and ii) a
	seasonally biased inflow shortage, as happened in 2002/03. The 25
	per cent low inflow scenario shows that significantly higher price
	effects are likely to occur in the Nordic power market in the
	future than in the past. However, the price effects are less than
	one would expect when compared to 2002/03, but prices remain higher
	for a longer period of time. The simulations do not indicate any
	problems in the functioning of the market within these scenarios.

Classification-JEL: D58; H22; H61
Abstract: The paper analyses how equilibrium adjustments of the wage rate
	affect the scope for tax rate reductions when the government
	experiences an exogenous increase in non-tax revenues. It shows
	within a stylized model that increased revenue in the form of a
	tradable will increase the wage rate, which diminishes the scope
	for tax rate reduction, provided that the initial wage dependent
	government net expenditures are positive. In this case the wage
	rate adjustment represents an automatic channel for redistributing
	increased non-tax government revenues. When the revenue increases
	in the form a non-tradable, the wage rate adjustment reinforces the
	scope for tax rate reduction. Simulations on a CGE model of the
	Norwegian economy confirm the theoretical results, and demonstrate
	that the fiscal wage effect can be strikingly large.

Keywords: Imperfect competition model; price markup; labor market

Classification-JEL: C23; E31; J51
Abstract: Existing literature have focused on the influence of
	institutional factors on wage determination when explaining the
	prolonged cross-country differences in unemployment. Although
	coordination of wage bargaining probably affects entry barriers and
	competition in product markets as well, research on price
	determination has typically not considered such factors. In this
	paper, an imperfect competition model - where the price markup
	depends on coordination of wage bargaining (and relative prices) -
	is set up and estimated on a panel of 15 OECD-countries. We derive
	a hypothesis that coordination has two separate effects on prices,
	i.e. an indirect effect through its effect on wages and a direct
	effect on the price markup. The estimates show that when we correct
	for the effect of coordination on wages, consumer prices may be as
	much as 21 percent higher in countries like Italy, the Netherlands,
	Ireland, Austria and Norway as compared to Canada, the US and the
	UK, due to the effect of coordination on the price markup. Since
	coordination probably has a dampening effect on wages, this may
	explain why many researchers have been unable to find any clear
	effect of coordination on unemployment in reduced form analysis.

Abstract: The financial markets in a small open economy like the

	in Norway, Sweden and Denmark are determined by fundamental

	conditions. Relating the level of interest rates to international
	macroeconomic variables also sheds some light on the degree of
	financial marketintegration. In Norway the currency risk, exchange
	rate regime, international debt and unemployment in Europe are
	significant in explaining the interest rate differential. In Sweden
	domestic and US inflation are important, while for Denmark domestic
	debt, domestic and US money stock, and less significantly US
	inflation are determinants of the interest rate differential. In
	these three countries with quite different economies the
	expectations hypothesis, the effect of domestic growth and
	unemployment and of international growth are not supported as
	determinants of long-term interest rate differentials.

Classification-JEL: C21; D12; R21
Abstract: Owner-occupied housing services and rented housing services are
	often considered close substitutes, and both house price and rental
	price indices rely on regressions based on dwelling and location
	characteristics. However, while such characteristics are exhaustive
	in the owner's market, they cannot capture the additional
	complexity of rental markets. This paper offers a theoretical
	framework and an empirical analysis of additional factors that
	affect rent. The factors comprise three categories: Landlord
	characteristics, tenant characteristics, and characteristics of the
	landlord-tenant interaction. We analyze a novel data set sampled
	from the Norwegian rental market and obtain substantial
	improvements in explanatory power by including information on
	tenant and landlord characteristics and interaction. While
	variation in geographical variables explains 17 percent of the
	variation in monthly rent; variation in hedonic variables explain
	only 12 percent. Variation in tenant and landlord characteristics
	and interaction explains as much as 15 percent of rent variation.
	The full model captures 44 percent of rent variation and offers
	insights into the monetary values of landlord type, market
	mediation, tenure length, tenant type, and services. This
	additional explanatory power accentuates the difference between the
	owner's and renter's market, and the results come with
	ramifications for the general understanding of the rental market,
	for construction of rental indices, and for the assumption of a
	rental-equivalence principle in CPI-construction.

	axioms yield different characterizations of the probabilities for
	choosing the respective risky prospects. An interesting feature of
	the models developed is that they allow for violations of the
	expected utility theory known as the common consequence effect and

Abstract: Large petroleum revenues make Norway an enviable fiscal loner.
	The fiscal policy rule adopted from 2001 transforms petroleum
	wealth into foreign assets, and only the real return on the
	financial fund should be spent annually. Despite this ambitious
	saving of the petroleum wealth, we find it unlikely that present
	tax rates and welfare schemes are sustainable in a long run
	perspective. Rather, the results from combining detailed models of
	demography and government expenditures with a detailed CGE model,
	suggest that Norway is exceptional also with respect to strong
	growth in government expenditures. In our baseline scenario the
	payroll tax rate must be increased continuously when ageing sets in
	after 2020, passing twice the present level about 2045. This is
	required even if the pension fund reaches 1.4 times GDP, commanding
	an unprecedented degree of fiscal discipline.

Abstract: Galí, Gertler and Lòpez-Salido (2005), GGL, assert that the
	hybrid New Keynesian Phillips curve, NPC, is robust to different
	choices of estimation procedure and so some forms of specification
	bias. Specifically, the dominance of forward-looking behavior is
	robust according to GGL. We assess the NPC on a panel data set from
	OECD countries and find that the forward rate of inflation
	dominates also on the panel data set. However, when variables
	consistent with alternative inflation models are introduced in the

Abstract: National and international expansion of transmission networks and
	diminishing returns to scale in hydropower capacity expansion has
	raised the opportunity cost of electricity. The resulting changes
	in comparative advantage between industries have in many countries
	been counteracted by government assistance to energy intensive
	industries. A good example is the implicit electricity price
	subsidies offered to energy intensive manufacturing in Norway
	through the state owned power company Statkraft. We use firm data
	to assess the share of firms that will survive in the long run when
	these subsidies are removed, highlighting that large cost
	heterogeneity within the industries may imply diminishing returns
	to scale at the industry level. This feature is incorporated in a
	multisectoral CGE model, which is used to estimate the equilibrium
	adjustments of the industry structure and relative prices of
	removing the subsidies. Such a policy will lead to a less
	specialised industry structure and reduces gross trade. The
	positive public budget effect allows the government to cut other
	taxes, which fuels the real exchange rate depreciation necessary to
	meet the national budget constraint.

Classification-JEL: C51; C52; E31; F31
Abstract: The New Keynesian Phillips Curve (NKPC) has become the benchmark
	model for understanding inflation in modern monetary economics. One
	reason for the popularity is the microfoundation of the model,
	which decomposes agents' behaviour into price adjustments and
	deviations of the price level from its target. The empirical
	relevance of the NKPC is, however, a matter of debate as recent
	studies reveal that some supportive evidence depends crucially on
	the econometric methods applied. We show how to evaluate the
	features of the model using cointegration techniques and tests
	based on both single-behavioural equations and cointegrated VAR
	models. Our results indicate that the forward-looking part of the
	NKPC is most likely at odds with Norwegian data. By contrast, we
	establish a well-specified dynamic model interpreted as a standard
	backward-looking mark-up price equation. We also demonstrate that
	the dynamic mark-up model forecasts well post-sample and during a
	major change in the monetary policy regime, which certainly is
	strong evidence in favour of this model. Consequently, we conclude
	that taking account of forward-looking behaviour when modelling
	consumer price inflation in Norway seems unnecessary to arrive at a
	well-specified model by econometric criteria.

Keywords: Inequality; skill premium; bargaining
Classification-JEL: D31; D33; J31; J50
Abstract: Rapid growth in productivity combined with increasing wage
	dispersion in some countries, notably Anglo-Saxon, has been the
	subject of numerous studies. The main hypothesis in the literature
	is that an increased skill premium provides a link between
	productivity growth and inequality. If this view is correct it
	poses some challenges for policies that focus on promoting a
	learning economy. However, data for many OECD-countries show that
	increased wage dispersion is not a common feature. Many countries
	have enjoyed a fairly stable or even declining dispersion of wages.
	Also in countries where the production and use of ITC-goods are
	significant, there are hardly any changes in wage dispersion. Thus
	one must look at a broader set of factors other than skilled biased
	technical change in order to explain the diverse picture of changes
	in inequality. This paper points to changes in educational
	attainment and institutions relating to wage bargaining as possible
	explanations for the varying experience wrt. wage inequality
	between OECD-countries in recent decades.

Classification-JEL:  
Abstract: Systematic sampling is a widely used technique in survey
	sampling. It is easy to execute, whether the units are to be
	selected with equal probability or with probabilities proportional
	to auxiliary sizes. It can be very efficient if one manages to
	achieve favourable stratification effects through the listing of
	units. The main disadvantages are that there is no unbiased method
	for estimating the sampling variance, and that systematic sampling
	may be poor when the ordering of the population is based on
	inaccurate knowledge. In this paper we examine an aspect of the
	systematic sampling that previously has not received much
	attention. It is shown that in a number of common situations, where
	the systematic sampling has on average the same efficiency as the
	corresponding random sampling alternatives under an assumed model
	for the population, the sampling variance fluctuates much more with
	the systematic sampling. The use of systematic sampling is
	associated with a risk that in general increases with the sampling
	fraction. This can be highly damaging for large samples from small
	populations in the case of single-stage sampling, or large
	sub-samples from small sub-populations as in the case of
	multi-stage sampling.

Abstract: We present a framework to identify and evaluate marginal tax
	reforms when merit good arguments and environmental concerns are
	given explicit consideration. It is applied to the Norwegian
	indirect tax system for 1999. The analysis shows that the reform
	passed in Parliament in November 2000 had a clear redistributive
	profile: a lowering of the VAT rate on food items and the
	introduction of a VAT on services benefits households in the lowest
	seven deciles while the upper three deciles got worse off. But we
	also argue that the aggregate demand responses triggered an
	increase in greenhouse gasses. Next, we show that if the 2000
	reform had been complemented with tax rates rate changes on other
	products, it could have made every decile better off. Finally, we
	present socially optimal reforms, under different weights on
	inequality and the environment.

Abstract: In this paper we analyze labor force participation with

	theoretical point of departure is a simple model where the worker
	evaluates the expected utility of searching for work, and decides
	to participate in the labor market if the expected utility of the
	search exceeds the utility of not working. With suitable
	assumptions about unobserved and observed heterogeneity we derive
	an empirical model for the probability that the worker will be
	unemployed or employed as a function of the probability of getting
	a job, given that the worker searches for work. The model is
	estimated on Norwegian micro-data consisting of independent cross
	sections over 15 years. The results indicate that there is a
	substantial discouraged worker effect.

Abstract: Heterogeneity in consumer behaviour creates differences in demand
	responses, which may create problems with aggregation across
	consumers. If aggregation problems exist, results from estimation
	based on aggregate data may prove difficult to interpret. Using
	estimation results from micro data to predict aggregate demand
	responses may also create disaggregation bias (the reverse
	aggregation problem). The aim of this paper is to discuss potential
	problems of using micro data to predict aggregate demand, and how
	such problems relate to the linear and non-linear aggregation
	problem. We also expand the theories of linear and non-linear
	aggregation to the case in which prices vary across agents. We
	formulate and test criteria for aggregation by using data on
	Norwegian household electricity consumption. We find clear evidence
	of aggregation problems, as heterogeneity in both price and income
	derivatives are significant. We thus expect to experience problems
	with aggregation when analysing Norwegian household electricity
	consumption.

Classification-JEL: C51; C52; H31; J22
Abstract: During the last two decades, the discrete-choice modelling of
	labour supply decisions has become increasingly popular, starting
	with Aaberge et al. (1995) and van Soest (1995). Within the
	literature adopting this approach there are however two potentially
	important issues that are worthwhile analyzing in their
	implications and that so far have not been given the attention they
	might deserve. A first issue concerns the procedure by which the
	discrete alternatives are selected to enter the choice set. For
	example van Soest (1995) chooses (non probabilistically) a set of
	fixed points identical for every individual. This is by far the
	most widely adopted method. By contrast, Aaberge et al. (1995)
	adopt a sampling procedure suggested by McFadden (1978) and also
	assume that the choice set may differ across the households. A
	second issue concerns the availability of the alternatives. Most
	authors assume all the values of hours-of-work within some range
	[0, H] are equally available. At the other extreme, some authors
	assume only two or three alternatives (e.g. non-participation,
	part-time and full-time) are available for everyone. Aaberge et al.
	(1995) assume instead that not all the hour opportunities are
	equally available to everyone; they specify a probability density
	function of opportunities for each individual and the discrete
	choice set used in the estimation is built by sampling from that
	individual-specific density function. In this paper we explore by
	simulation the implications of - the procedure used to build the
	choice set (fixed alternatives vs sampled alternatives) -
	accounting or not accounting for a different availability of
	alternatives. The way the choice set is represented seems to have
	little impact on the fitting of observed values, but a more
	significant and important impact on the out-of-sample prediction
	performance.

Abstract: According to environmental interests groups governments should
	use their climate policy strategically in order to provide for a
	faster introduction of new, cleaner technologies. Strategic use of
	climate policy could also induce the development of a successful
	upstream abatement technology industry like the Danish windmill
	industry. Interestingly, this latter question has not been analyzed
	theoretically before. Our point of departure is a three-stage game
	between a government in a small country with a climate restriction,
	and a limited number of firms supplying carbon abatement
	technology. The government moves first, and may use its climate
	policy strategically to influence the behavior of the upstream
	technology firms. An especially stringent climate policy towards
	the polluting downstream sector may then in fact be well founded.
	It will increase the competition between the technology suppliers,
	and lead to lower domestic abatement costs. However, to our
	surprise, a strict environmental policy is not a particularly good
	industrial policy with respect to developing new successful export
	sectors.

	emissions to GDP. Therefore, as far as the four types of air
	emissions in Norway are concerned, the presumption, employed in the
	conventional EKC analyses that the causal relationship between
	emissions and GDP is unidirectional from the latter to the former,
	may be retained for CO2 and CO only. For SO2 and NOx, however, it
	is rejected.

Abstract: Offering electricity consumers time-differentiated tariffs may

	However, one concern is that time-differentiated tariffs may also
	attract consumers who benefit because of their consumption pattern,
	even without a corresponding demand response. A discrete choice
	model applied to data from a residential dynamic pricing experiment
	indicates that higher demand flexibility increases the propensity
	of a household to select dynamic tariffs, while favourable
	consumption patterns do not influence the tariff choice. The
	offering of dynamic time-differentiated tariffs is then likely to
	increase the demand response among residential consumers.

Abstract: Gazprom, the dominant gas company in Russia, is widely believed
	to be the key supplier of gas to Europe in the foreseeable future.
	However, there are numerous uncertainties and challenges within the
	Russian and European gas industry that may alter the allocation of
	Gazprom´s gas sales between domestic and export markets. In this
	paper we use both theoretical and numerical models to study
	potential effects on Russian gas exports from changes in Russian
	domestic gas prices and the production capacities in 2015. We also
	investigate whether the liberalization of the European gas markets
	may provide incentives for Gazprom to induce monopoly power in its
	export markets. Our main findings suggest that both increased
	domestic gas prices and sufficient production capacities are vital
	to maintain Gazprom´s market share in Europe over the next decade.
	At low domestic prices, Gazprom may even have difficulties to carry
	out its long-term export commitments. However, if export
	possibilities are ample due to both lower domestic demand at higher
	prices and high overall production capacities, a large share of
	spot trades in Europe may encourage Gazprom to exercise market
	power in its export markets.

Abstract: Time-series regressions including non-linear transformations of
	an integrated variable are not uncommon in various fields of
	economics. In particular, within the Environmental Kuznets Curve
	(EKC) literature, where the effect on the environment of income
	levels is investigated, it is standard procedure to include a third
	order polynomial in the income variable. When the income variable
	is an I(1)-variable and this variable is also included nonlinearly
	in the regression relation, the properties of the estimators and
	standard inferential procedures are unknown. Surprisingly, such
	problems have received rather limited attention in applied work,
	and appear disregarded in the EKC literature. We investigate the
	properties of the estimators of long-run parameters using
	Monte-Carlo simulations. We find that the mean of the ordinary
	least squares estimates are very similar to the true values and
	that standard testing procedures based on normality behave rather
	well.

Classification-JEL: C33; C51; C61; C72; D21
Abstract: We use the Stock and Wise approximation of stochastic dynamic
	programming in order to identify the extent to which profitability
	can explain exit behavior. In our econometric model, heterogeneous
	firms engage in Bertrand (price) competition. Firms produce
	heterogeneous products, using labor, materials and capital as
	inputs. The stock of capital is changed through investments and
	disinvestments, where the firm incurs adjustment costs due to
	partial irreversibilities. The model is estimated for six
	manufacturing industries using Norwegian micro data for the period
	1993-2002. We find that increased profitability lowers the exit
	probability, and this effect is statistically significant in all
	industries, while, ceteris paribus, high adjustment costs
	significantly decrease the probability of exit in five of the
	industries. Exiting firms are characterized by persistently,
	although only moderately higher, annual exit probabilities than the
	average firm. There is no tendency for exiting firms to have a high
	probability of exit just prior to exit.

Classification-JEL: C13; C33; D21; D24
Abstract: This paper describes firms' output and factor demand before,
	during and after episodes of lumpy investments using a rich
	employer-employee panel data set for two manufacturing industries
	and one service industry. We focus on the simultaneous adjustment
	of capital, materials, man-hours, as well as the skill composition
	and hourly cost of labour. The investment spikes lead to roughly
	proportional changes in sales, labour and materials, while capital
	intensity increases significantly. Capital adjustments are found to
	be smoother in the service industry than in the two manufacturing
	industries, a difference that may be related to the labour
	intensity in the service industry. Finally, the changes in
	productivity associated with episodes of investment spikes are
	small, indicating that productivity improvements are related to
	learning-by-doing rather than instantaneous technological changes
	through investment spikes.

Keywords: Individual prediction; business survey; unequal probability
	sampling; two-stage sampling; linear regression population; common

Classification-JEL:  
Abstract: Standard approaches to sample surveys take as the point of
	departure the estimation of one or several population totals (or
	means), or a few predefined sub-totals (or sub-means). While the
	model-based prediction approach provides an attractive framework
	for estimation and inference, a model-based theory for the variety
	of randomization sampling designs has been lacking. In this paper
	we extend the model-based approach to the prediction of individuals
	in addition to totals and means. Since, given the sample, the
	conditional prediction error is zero for the selected units but
	positive for the units outside of the sample, it is possible to use
	the sampling design to control the unconditional individual
	prediction mean square errors. This immediately raises the need for
	probability sampling. It turns out that balancing between optimal
	prediction of the population total and control over individual
	predictions provides a fruitful model-based approach to sampling
	design. Apart from raising the need for probability sampling in
	general, it leads naturally to a number of important design
	features that are firmly established in the sampling practice,
	including the use of simple random sampling for homogeneous
	populations and unequal probability sampling otherwise, the
	division of a business population into the take-all, take-some and
	take-none units, the most common two-stage sampling designs, the
	use of stratification with proportional allocation, etc.. Most of
	them have not received adequate model-based treatment previously.
	Our approach enables us to give an appraisal of these methods from
	a prediction point of view.

Abstract: Several studies reject the implications of the altruism model. In

	their children both are altruistic and influenced by an equal

	compensation should be stronger in one-child families and we expect
	the altruism motive to dominate the fairness norm when income

	indicates that this stability is unlikely to persist and that
	current trends in regional per capita emissions are in close
	agreement with the IPCC scenarios

Keywords: The Gini coefficient; the Bonferroni coefficient; rank-dependent
	measures of inequality; decomposition by subgroups
Classification-JEL:  
Abstract: The purpose of additive subgroup decomposition is to study the
	relationship between overall inequality and inequality within and
	between population subgroups defined by variables like gender, age,
	education and region of residence. As opposed to the inequality
	measures that are additively decomposable, the so-called
	generalized entropy family of inequality measures, the Gini
	coefficient does not admit decomposition into within- and
	between-group components but does also require an interaction
	(overlapping) term. The purpose of this paper is to introduce an
	alternative decomposition method that can be considered to be a
	parallel to Lerman and Yitzhaki’s (1985) elasticity approach for
	decomposing the Gini coefficient by income sources, which means
	that the elasticity of the Gini coefficient with respect to various
	income components is treated as the basic quantities of the
	decomposition method. Thus, rather than decomposing the Gini
	coefficient or any other inequality measure into a
	within-inequality term, a between-inequality term and eventually an
	interaction term, the basic quantities of the introduced method are
	the effects of marginal changes in variables that are used to
	specify the population subgroups

Keywords: Climate agreements; compliance; enforcement; emissions trading;
	carbon taxes.
Classification-JEL: Q30; Q41
Abstract: One of the proposed alternatives to Kyoto’s cap-and-trade
	approach is a regime based on an internationally harmonized carbon
	tax. In this paper, we consider and compare the enforcement
	problems associated with a tax regime and a cap-and-trade regime,
	respectively. The paper tries to convey two main points. First,
	both types of regime require an effective enforcement mechanism.
	However, such a mechanism is unlikely to be adopted as part of a
	regime with full participation, because the political process
	leading up to its adoption tends to water down the enforcement
	mechanism to a point where it no longer has much bite. And even if
	this is somehow avoided, countries expecting compliance to be
	difficult or costly will almost certainly decline to sign – not to
	mention ratify – the resulting agreement. Second, the implications
	of non-compliance in a tax regime differ in important ways from the
	corresponding implications in a cap-and-trade regime. In a
	cap-and-trade regime emissions trading can make inaction legitimate
	for buyers of emission permits. In particular, overselling of
	permits by one (or a few) permit exporting countries might
	completely undermine the regime’s environmental effect. In a tax
	regime, by contrast, one country's non-compliance can not make
	inaction by other countries legitimate. It follows that an
	agreement based on a harmonized carbon tax will always have some
	effect, provided that at least one country complies.

Classification-JEL: H55; I12; I38; J63; J65
Abstract: We investigate the impact of plant downsizing on disability
	pension utilization in Norway. Plant downsizing substantially
	increases the disability entry rate of workers in affected plants.
	Workers originally employed in plants that closed between 1993 and
	1998 were 27.9 percent more likely to utilize disability pensions
	in 1999 than comparable workers in non-downsizing plants. The
	effect of downsizing is non-linear, with workers originally
	employed in plants downsizing 65-95 percent of their workforce more
	likely to enter disability than workers in fully closing plants.
	This is consistent with the signaling story of Gibbons and Katz
	(1991). We also estimate significant effects of downsizing on
	future earnings and mortality, suggesting the increase in
	disability participation could be driven by an adverse effect of
	downsizing on the economic opportunities or health of affected
	workers

Abstract: In this paper, we describe the approach to, and experience of,

	background to electricity market reform, the analytical and legal
	foundations for reform, and the chosen market and regulatory
	design. We find that the market has performed well in terms of
	economic efficiency and market functionality, even when exposed to
	severe supply shocks because of water shortages for a power system
	that relies heavily on hydropower. However, we also identify issues
	and challenges that must be addressed to improve the performance of
	the Nordic electricity market and its regulatory system.

Abstract: Welfare analysis of energy taxes typically shows that systems
	with uniform rates perform better than differentiated systems.
	However, most western countries include some exemptions for their
	energy-intensive export industry, and hence, avoid this potential
	welfare gain. Böhringer and Rutherford (1997) find that compared to
	a differentiated system, uniform taxation in combination with a
	wage subsidy preserve jobs in these industries at a fraction of the
	potential welfare gain in the German economy. This result holds in
	this Norwegian study where a more broad based subsidy scheme,
	represented by production dependent subsidies, is used to protect
	jobs in the Norwegian energy-intensive industry. However, the
	welfare cost per job preserved by this subsidy scheme amounts to
	about 60 percent of the wage cost per job, suggesting that these
	jobs are expensive to preserve.

Keywords: Climate change; electricity market
Classification-JEL: q11;q21;q42
Abstract: Concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere influences
	the climate, which then alters the amount of primary energy for
	countries or regions where hydropower and wind power constitute
	important parts of the energy supply. Besides, the demand effect of
	temperature increases may be large in economies where heating and
	air-conditioning demand a large share of total energy. In this
	article, we apply climate change calculations from natural science
	and detailed inflow data from the authorities to estimate the
	change in primary energy supply of the hydropower-dominated Nordic
	electricity market. The estimated inflow model shows an increase in
	primary inflow in the next 40 years of 6–15% in the Nordic
	countries. An estimated temperature model shows a 2–4% initial drop
	in demand in the same time period, because of increasing
	temperature. Within the context of a perfect-competition
	electricity market model, we simulate the total market outcome. As
	primary supply increases, the production cost decreases, prices
	drop and the total demand increases as the price effect dominates
	the temperature effect. Since the hydropower plants are located
	away from large consumer groups, the stress on the transmission
	networks is dramatic for some regions, which in the next phase may
	trigger new investments in transmission network capacities.

Abstract: Several small open economies switched to inflation targeting
	during the 1990s, thereby giving up various forms of exchange rate
	targeting in favour of flexible exchange rates. Norway did the same
	early in 2001, and has thereafter experienced highly varying
	nominal exchange rates with consumer price inflation dropping far
	below the target during 2003 and 2004. Knowledge of the degree of
	exchange rate pass-through to import prices and further to consumer
	prices is essential for inflation targeting. The literature
	suggests that pass-through is greater to import prices than to
	consumer prices, which presumably is related to the role of
	distributors in the economy. We present empirical evidence on these
	issues for Norway by estimating import price equations and a
	dynamic model of the distributors pricing behaviour. Using a
	large-scale macroeconometric model of the Norwegian economy, we
	find exchange rate pass-through to import prices to be quite rapid
	in the short run, while pass-through to consumer prices seems to be
	modest. We show that, among the numerous channels through which the
	exchange rate operate, trade margins in the distribution sector act
	as cushions to exchange rate fluctuations, thereby being one of the
	main important source for the delay in pass-through. In spite of
	moderate pass-through to consumer prices, we find inflationary
	effects of exchange rate changes even in the short run, an insight
	important for inflation targeting central banks.

Abstract: Indirect taxes on transportation activities that pollute can
	correct externalities and close the gaps between private and social
	costs. However, policy makers often find such Pigou taxes difficult
	to implement because of political resistance due to possibly
	adverse affects on equity. For this reason it is important to
	assess the distributional aspects of environmental levies. This
	article estimates properties of the demand for transportation in
	parametric and non-parametric analyses of Consumer Expenditure
	Surveys for the United States, 2000, and finds patterns in the
	resulting set of Engel curves. Private transportation using air
	flights and new automobiles have Engel elasticities above unity
	while public transportation via mass transit has Engel elasticity
	below unity. The findings can be interpreted in an important way
	since they show that a differentiated scheme of environmental taxes
	on transportation may function progressively. A Pigou scheme with
	larger taxes on modes of transportation that pollute more appears
	to coincide with larger levies on luxury modes preferred by richer
	households.

Abstract: Measuring change in the price of housing is an important and
	notoriously difficult task for national statistical agencies.
	Different approaches have been attempted, but suffer from known
	weaknesses. This article suggests dividing housing outlays into
	consumption and saving. The changes in prices of the consumption
	component are governed primarily by the purchasing price and the
	interest rate, and lead us to the construction of a consumption
	cost index. We show that over the lifespan of the mortgage, under
	some general assumptions, the price changes most relevant for
	inflation measurement can be obtained from a housing price index.
	The main challenge lies in computing weights for the housing
	consumption index. We demonstrate how this can be done in practice.
	An empirical example using data from Norway shows that over the
	12-month period from June 2003 to June 2004 the official inflation
	was measured at 1.3%. This did not properly account for a 10.2%
	increase in house prices. The methodology proposed in this paper
	estimates the 12-month inflation at 3.4%.

	identifies the contributions from substitution at the micro level,
	as well as changes in the industry structure to the substitution at
	the aggregate level. It also separates the substitution effects of
	equilibrium adjustments of other prices than the electricity price,
	and macroeconomic income effects on total demand. The direct price
	elasticity of aggregate electricity demand is estimated to -0.31.
	Within industry factor substitution contributes most to this

Abstract: The barrier model of productivity growth suggests that individual
	country productivity is related to the world technology frontier
	disturbed by national barriers. We offer a country study of the
	barrier model exploiting the dramatic changes in the linkages to
	the world economy in South Africa. The productivity growth in the
	manufacturing sector panel for 1970-2003 covers a period of
	political and economic turbulence and international sanctions. The
	econometric analysis uses tariffs as measure of barrier and fixed
	effects estimation to concentrate inference to time series
	properties. The model shows how productivity growth can be
	understood as a combination of world frontier growth and the tariff
	barrier to international spillovers. The estimates establish a long
	run relationship where domestic productivity follows the world
	frontier and with change of the barrier affecting transitional
	growth.

Abstract: The mobility of the tax base may influence fiscal outcomes. The
	many theoretical contributions about the role of mobility are not
	matched by empirical evidence. Existing studies address strategic
	interaction between governments, but have little to say about
	mobility. We introduce a new measure of mobility conditions based
	on the geographic profit variability of industrial sectors. The
	econometric analysis shows a systematic negative relationship
	between mobility conditions and tax level among municipalities in
	Norway. The analysis takes into account neighborhood effects in a
	spatial model, and the endogeneity of mobility conditions is
	handled with instrumental variables.

Classification-JEL: C32; F31.
Abstract: This paper addresses the purchasing power parity (PPP) puzzle for
	commodity currencies. A substantial part of the literature on
	commodity currencies has found that, despite controlling for the
	effect of commodity prices, PPP does not hold in the long run. We
	show that once we also control for the effect of the interest rate
	differential in the real exchange rate relationship, the
	discrepancies from PPP are fully accounted for. The analysis is
	applied to the real exchange rate behaviour in Norway, which has a
	primary commodity (oil) that constitutes the majority of its
	exports. We show that with the interest rate differential included
	in the long run real exchange rate relationship, the real oil price
	plays a minor role. Adjustment to equilibrium (half-lives) is also
	substantially reduced, taking no more than one year on average.
	Hence, contrary to earlier findings on commodity currencies, we
	have effectively removed the PPP puzzle.

Classification-JEL: C32; C51; C52.
Abstract: The paper describes a procedure for decomposing the deterministic
	terms in cointegrated VAR models into growth rate parameters and
	cointegration mean parameters. These parameters express long-run
	properties of the model. For example, the growth rate parameters
	tell us how much to expect (unconditionally) the variables in the
	system to grow from one period to the next, representing the
	underlying (steady state) growth in the variables. The procedure
	can be used for analysing structural breaks when the deterministic
	terms include shift dummies and broken trends. By decomposing the
	coefficients into interpretable components, different types of
	structural breaks can be identified. Both shifts in intercepts and
	shifts in growth rates, or combinations of these, can be tested
	for. The ability to distinguish between different types of
	structural breaks makes the procedure superior compared to
	alternative procedures. Furthermore, the procedure utilizes the
	information more efficiently than alternative procedures. Finally,
	interpretable coefficients of different types of structural breaks
	can be identified.

Classification-JEL: C42; C13; C15
Abstract: Multiple imputation is a method specifically designed for
	variance estimation in the presence of missing data. Rubin’s
	combination formula requires that the imputation method is “proper”
	which essentially means that the imputations are random draws from
	a posterior distribution in a Bayesian framework. In national
	statistical institutes (NSI’s) like Statistics Norway, the methods
	used for imputing for nonresponse are typically non-Bayesian, e.g.,
	some kind of stratified hot-deck. Hence, Rubin’s method of multiple
	imputation is not valid and cannot be applied in NSI’s. This paper
	deals with the problem of deriving an alternative combination
	formula that can be applied for imputation methods typically used
	in NSI’s and suggests an approach for studying this problem.
	Alternative combination formulas are derived for certain response
	mechanisms and hot-deck type imputation methods.

Abstract: A regression equation for panel data with two-way random or fixed
	effects and a set of individual specific and period specific
	`within individual' and `within period', estimators of its slope
	coefficients are considered. They can be given Ordinary Least
	Squares (OLS) or Instrumental Variables (IV) interpretations. A
	class of estimators, obtained as an arbitrary linear combination of
	these `disaggregate' estimators, is defined and an expression for
	its variance-covariance matrix is derived. Nine familiar
	`aggregate' estimators which utilize the entire data set, including
	two between, three within, three GLS, as well as the standard OLS,
	emerge by specific choices of the weights. Other estimators in this
	class which are more robust to simultaneity and measurement error
	bias than the standard aggregate estimators and more efficient than
	the `disaggregate' estimators, are also considered. An empirical
	illustration of robustness and efficiency, relating to
	manufacturing productivity, is given.

	workers with high innate ability to choose an educational type with
	high consumption value and low effort costs. This increases the
	skill mismatch and aggregate unemployment in the economy. The
	government can correct for this distortion by use of differentiated
	tuition fees or tax rates.

Abstract: A much higher old-age dependency ratio together with more

	the future pension burden in Norway. The challenges of financing
	the increasing pension expenditures depend on the development in
	demographic characteristics like fertility, mortality and
	immigration, as well as characteristics affecting supply of labour,
	like education, disability, retirement age, participation rates and
	part time work (especially for women), and the design of the
	pension system. By use of a dynamic micro simulation model the
	paper analyses and projects how these factors will affect the
	expenditures and financing of the Norwegian National Insurance
	Scheme. The model also allows analyses of distributional effects of
	pension reforms.

Abstract: Ageing combined with generous welfare state schemes makes the
	present fiscal policy in Norway unsustainable, despite large
	government petroleum revenues. We estimate to what extent two
	suggested reforms of the public pension system improve fiscal
	sustainability and stimulate employment, two main objectives of the
	reforms. To this end we apply two large models iteratively: 1) a
	detailed dynamic micro simulation model to estimate government
	pension expenditures; 2) a large CGE-model to estimate general
	equilibrium effects on all tax bases and employment, i.e.
	macroeconomic effects. We find that the reform proposals have much
	larger effects than typically found for reforms of the tax and
	trade policy. Whereas maintaining the present system implies that
	the payroll tax rate must be increased from about 13 percent today
	to 25 percent in 2050, both proposals imply that taxes can be
	reduced from the present level in all years up to 2050. Most of
	this reduction can be attributed to higher employment.

Classification-JEL: L13; Q31; Q41
Abstract: High oil prices are favourable for OPEC in the short run, but may
	undermine its future revenues. We search for the optimal oil price
	level for the producer group, using a partial equilibrium model for
	the oil market. The model explicitly accounts for reserves,
	development and production in 4 field categories across 13 regions.
	Oil companies may invest in new field development or alternatively
	in improved oil recovery in the decline phase of fields in
	production. Non-OPEC production is profit-driven, whereas OPEC
	meets the residual call on OPEC oil at a pre-specified oil price,
	while maintaining a surplus capacity. According to our results,
	sustained high oil prices stimulate Non-OPEC production, but its
	remaining reserves gradually diminish despite new discoveries. Oil
	demand is only slightly affected by higher prices. Thus, OPEC is
	able to keep and eventually increase its current market share
	beyond 2010 even with oil prices around $30 per barrel (2000-$). In
	fact, an oil price around $40 seems to be profitable for OPEC, even
	if long-term revenues are not discounted. Sensitivity analyses show
	that even with many factors working jointly in OPEC's disfavour,
	the optimal oil price seems to be at least $25. Thus, for OPEC
	there is a trade-off between high prices and high market share in
	the short to medium term, but not in the long term. For OECD
	countries, on the other hand, there is a clear trade-off between
	low oil prices and low import dependence.

Abstract: The primus inter pares of the UN Millennium Development Goals is
	to reduce poverty. The only internationally accepted method of
	estimating poverty requires a measurement of total consumption
	based on a time and resource demanding household budget or
	integrated survey over 12 months. Rather than measuring poverty
	only, say every 5th year, a model is presented to predict poverty
	based upon a small set of household variables to be collected
	yearly between two 12 months household surveys. Information
	obtained from the light surveys may then be used to predict poverty
	rates. The key question is whether the inaccuracy in these
	predictions is acceptable. The standard errors presented are lower
	than the sampling errors to the poverty estimates based on the 12
	months household surveys. Predictions based on this sample also
	indicate that the problem of misspecifications of models is not
	large. It is recommended to test these models at the country level
	and if the test results are comparable to those here, apply the
	approach presented.

Abstract: The seminal paper by Pissarides and Weber (1989) is one of
	several previous studies trying to measure the size of the black
	economy. Pissarides and Weber compared the relationship between
	food expenditure and income in two groups of workers, self-employed
	and employees in employment, assuming that employees reported
	income correctly. For a given level of reported income, the
	self-employed had a higher food expenditure than employees.
	Pissarides and Weber concluded that self-employed's actual income
	was 1.55 times reported income, and that this part of the black
	economy was about 5.5 percent of GDP in the UK in 1982. Presumably
	due to a too informal argumentation, Pissarides and Weber's
	estimators are not entirely correct and alternative estimators have
	been overlooked. In all, I suggest three different interval
	estimators for mean under-reporting. The first is obtained by
	formally solving optimization problems which Pissarides and Weber
	tried to solve informally. The other two follows from recognizing,
	and incorporating, parameter restrictions which were not fully
	appreciated.

Abstract: Norway's petroleum wealth has become considerably more liquid and
	thereby visible to the public since the mid 1990s. In the policy
	debate transformation of wealth is often confused with ordinary
	income. Such a misconception may have contributed to
	de-industrialisation through real appreciation beyond what is
	sustainable in a long run perspective. Since re-industrialisation
	is typically considered difficult, it is important to estimate a
	norm for sustainable wage growth. In Norway the textbook model of
	the Small Open Economy (SOE) has often been used for this purpose.
	We argue that this model neglects important aspects of the
	Norwegian economy. Instead we use a large scale dynamic CGE-model
	to estimate sustainable paths for wage growth and the activity in
	the traded goods sector, especially manufacturing. Under plausible
	assumptions we find that about 0.5 percent annual reduction of
	manufacturing employment is sustainable. The real appreciation over
	the last 7 years has been substantially above a sustainable trend.

Classification-JEL: C14; D31; D63
Abstract: We consider concepts and models that are useful for measuring how
	strongly the distribution of a positive response Y is concentrated
	near a value with a focus on how concentration varies as a function
	of covariates. We combine ideas from statistics, economics and
	reliability theory. Lorenz introduced a device for measuring
	inequality in the distribution of incomes that indicate how much
	the incomes below the uth quantile fall short of the egalitarian
	situation where everyone has the same income. Gini introduced an
	index that is the average over u of the difference between the
	Lorenz curve and its values in the egalitarian case. More
	generally, we can think of the Lorenz and Gini concepts as measures
	of concentration that applies to other response variables in
	addition to incomes, e.g. wealth, sales, dividends, taxes, test
	scores, precipitation, and crop yield. In this paper we propose
	modified versions of the Lorenz and Gini measures of concentration
	that we relate to statistical concepts of dispersion. Moreover, we
	consider the situation where the measures of
	concentration/dispersion are functions of covariates. We consider
	the estimation of these functions for parametric models and a
	semiparametric model involving regression coefficients and an
	unknown baseline distribution. In this semiparametric model, which
	combines ideas from Pareto, Lehmann and Cox, we find partial
	likelihood estimates of the regression coefficients and the
	baseline distribution that can be used to construct estimates of
	the various measures of concentration/dispersion.

Abstract: The Integration Pollution and Prevention Control (IPPC) directive
	from the European Union implies that the regulatory emission caps
	should be set in accordance with each industry’s Best Available
	Techniques (BAT). The directive is under implementation in Norway,
	and it represents a refocus of the Norwegian environmental
	regulations away from economic efficiency towards a BAT principle.
	We examine the effect of this implementation with respect to
	expected emission reductions and increases in costs. Data
	Envelopment Analyses (DEA) is used to construct a frontier of all
	efficient plants. This provides us with two alternative
	interpretations of BAT. First, we assume that all the plants emit
	in accordance with the best practice technology, represented by the
	frontier, by reducing all inputs proportionally. Second, we assume
	that all plants emit in accordance with the best practice
	technology by reducing emissions only. Both interpretations reveal
	substantial potential for emission reductions. Further, abatement
	cost estimates indicate that considerable emission reductions can
	be achieved with low or no social costs, but that the
	implementation of BAT for all plants involves substantial costs.

Abstract: This paper addresses the frequently articulated worry for the
	unemployment impacts of abating CO2 emissions. The Spanish economy
	is ridden by unemployment rates well above the EU average. At the
	same time the deviation from EU's intermediate emission goals is
	more serious than for most other EU countries. We use a CGE model
	that includes a matching model with two types of labour, and which
	allows for different pricing rules and returns-to-scale
	assumptions. Our findings are optimistic. Due to low labour
	intensity in most of the dirty, Spanish industries, the
	unemployment rate is hardly affected by introducing an emission
	permit system. Further, by recycling the sales revenue into reduced
	labour taxes, unemployment rates fall. Contrary to other studies of
	Europe, we find that reducing payroll taxes on skilled labour is
	the most successful in reducing unemployment rates, both through
	increasing demand and through dampening the supply response to
	rising wages. All the recycling schemes also generate dividends in
	terms of welfare, but none offset the abatement costs entirely.

Keywords: Measurement of poverty; poverty line; geographical and

Classification-JEL: I32
Abstract: The standard practice in most OECD countries is to measure and
	evaluate poverty on the basis of a poverty line defined as a
	specific proportion of the median equivalent income within a
	country. However, this approach disregards regional differences in
	prices and needs within a country and may, therefore, provide an
	incomplete and even an incorrect picture of the extent as well as
	the geographical and demographical composition of the poor. To
	account for differences in prices and needs, this paper introduces
	an alternative method of measuring poverty based on a set of
	region-specific poverty lines. Applying Norwegian household
	register data for 2001 we find that the overall extent of poverty
	is only slightly affected by the change in definition of poverty
	line. However, the geographical as well as the demographical
	composition of poverty are shown to depend heavily on whether the
	method of measuring poverty relies on region-specific or
	country-specific thresholds. As expected, the results demonstrate
	that the analysis of poverty based on country-specific thresholds
	produces downward biased poverty rates in urban areas and upward
	biased poverty rates in rural areas. Moreover, when region-specific
	poverty thresholds form the basis of the poverty analysis, we find
	that the poverty rates among young singles and non-western
	immigrants are significantly higher than what is suggested by
	previous empirical evidence based on a joint country-specific
	poverty line.

Abstract: The paper presents a method for computing the curvature implicit
	in the use of superlative price indices. It extends the quadratic
	lemma and allows us to compute the elasticity of substitution of
	the underlying preferences in the direction of the observed price
	change for the Törnqvist and the quadratic mean of order r indices.
	It derives the expressions for the directional shadow elasticity of
	substitution and applies the results to the Norwegian CPI data
	base.

	programming model is speci.ed and estimated on micro data. The
	estimation results show that a model, which uses only measures of
	economic incentives: wages and pension benefits gives a
	satisfactory fit to the observed retirement pattern. The results
	also indicate that husbands have higher bargaining power within the
	household. A hypothetical policy simulation shows that by taxing
	pension bene.ts as wage income, the labor market participation of
	both husbands and wives will increase around 4 percentage points at
	age 65.

	households engage in a cooperative bargaining process. The
	estimation results show that more than half of the households are
	of the non-cooperative type.

Classification-JEL: Q32; Q42; O30; Q25
Abstract: This article discusses how different climate policy instruments
	such as CO2 taxes and renewable energy subsidies affect the
	profitability of fossil fuel production, given that a fixed global
	climate target shall be achieved in the long term. Within an
	intertemporal framework, the model analyses show that CO2 taxes
	reduce the short-term profitability to a greater extent than
	technology subsidies, since the competition from CO2-free energy
	sources does not become particularly noticeable until decades
	later. Due to e.g. discounting of future revenues, most fossil fuel
	producers therefore prefer subsidies to their competitors above CO2
	taxes. However, this conclusion does not apply to all producers.
	Oil producers outside OPEC lose the most on the subsidising of
	CO2-free energy, while CO2 taxes only slightly reduce their
	profits. This is connected to OPEC’s role in the oil market, as the
	cartel chooses to reduce its extraction significantly in the tax
	scenario. The results seem to be consistent with observed behaviour
	of important players in the climate negotiations.

Keywords: The Lorenz curve; the Gini coefficient; rank-dependent measures

	distribution theory.
Classification-JEL: C14; D 63
Abstract: A major aim of most income distribution studies is to make
	comparisons of income inequality across time for a given country
	and/or compare and rank different countries according to the level
	of income inequality. However, most of these studies lack
	information on sampling errors, which makes it difficult to judge
	the significance of the attained rankings. The purpose of this
	paper it to derive the asymptotic properties of the empirical
	rank-dependent family of inequality measures. A favourable feature
	of this family of inequality measures is that it includes the Gini
	coefficients, and that any member of this family can be given an
	explicit and simple expression in terms of the Lorenz curve. By
	relying on a result of Doksum (1974) it is easily demonstrated that
	the empirical Lorenz curve, regarded as a stochastic process,
	converges to a Gaussian process. Moreover, this result forms the
	basis of the derivation of the asymptotic properties of the
	empirical rank-dependent measures of inequality.

Abstract: How do firms differ, and why do they differ even within narrowly
	defined industries? Using evidence from a new panel data set for
	four high-tech, manufacturing industries covering a 10-year period,
	we show how differences in sales, materials, labor costs and
	capital across firms can be summarized by firm-specific, dynamic
	factors, which we interpret in view of a structural model. The
	model contains the complete system of supply and factor demand
	equations. Our results show that a firm's efficiency is strongly
	linked to profitability and firm size, but only weakly related to
	labor productivity. Our second task is to understand the origin and
	evolution of the differences in efficiency. Among the firms
	established within the 10-year period that we consider permanent
	differences in efficiency dominate over differences generated by
	firm-specific, cumulated innovations.

Classification-JEL: D12; Q41
Abstract: Zero expenditure poses several challenges when estimating demand
	systems. Zero expenditure on energy goods occur due to limited
	opportunity to consume the good or because the household chooses
	not to use all available equipment (corner solution). In this paper
	we develop a method to estimate an Almost Ideal Demand System
	(AIDS) of household energy demand simultaneously using a Maximum
	Likelihood approach. The multivariate density of energy
	expenditures depends on the consumption opportunity of the
	individual household. We model the choice of corner solutions by a
	stochastic Kuhn-Tucker condition, and distinguish between zero
	expenditure due to limited consumption opportunities and corner
	solutions by using a Double Hurdle model. We find that accounting
	for zero expenditure in the estimation has a significant effect on
	the estimated parameters. Assuming stochastic interdependence
	between expenditures on different energy goods within the
	household, in addition to accounting for zero expenditure, has only
	a minor effect on the estimated coefficients.

Abstract: Public R&D subsidies aim to target particularly risky R&D and R&D
	with large externalities. One would expect many such projects to
	fail from a commercial point of view, but they may still produce
	knowledge with social value. Such knowledge is likely to be
	embodied in workers or teams of workers. I utilize a large matched
	employer-employee data set and test for knowledge diffusion from
	subsidised technology firms transmitted through the labor market.
	The specific case analysed is a series of Norwegian IT-programs so
	far considered unsuccessful, but which have been linked to the rise
	of a new generation of successful IT-firms. It has been argued that
	know-how and networks built up in leading companies during the
	programs still `fertilize' the IT-industry even though many of the
	companies have exited. I find limited support for this claim. On
	the positive side, the market value of work experience from
	subsidized firms does not seem to have been reduced by the fact
	that the firms did not succeed commercially, but workers from
	subsidized firms have not outperformed similar workers without this
	experience, either. Furthermore, firms that are spin-offs from
	formerly subsidized firms seem to perform below, rather than above
	average.

Abstract: The environmental risk associated with genetically modified

	risk management and risk communication are needed. In this paper we
	discuss the role of the precautionary principle in policy responses
	to GMO risk. We first discuss application of the criteria in the
	European Environment Agency report “Late lessons from early
	warnings: The precautionary principle 1896-2000” to environmental
	GMO risk, with focus on crop plants. Moreover, we discuss Bayesian
	analysis in the context of improving the informational basis for
	decision making under uncertainty. Finally, environmental
	uncertainties are intertwined with economic uncertainties.
	Providing incentives for improved risk assessment, risk management
	and risk communication is crucial for enhancing social and
	environmental responsibility and thereby facilitate implementation
	of precautionary approaches. We discuss ethical screening of
	companies as an example of how such incentives can be provided.

Classification-JEL: I21; I28; J24
Abstract: Whether increasing resource use in schools has a positive effect
	on pupil performance has occupied governments, parents and
	researchers for decades. A main challenge when trying to answer
	this question is to separate the effects of school resources from
	the effects of pupils’ family background, since resources may be
	allocated in a compensatory manner, and pupils may sort into
	schools. We address these issues using a comprehensive dataset for
	two cohorts of pupils graduating from lower secondary school in
	Norway. The dataset is rich in performance measures, resource use
	variables and family background variables. As performance measures
	we use results at age 16 across 11 subjects, and we exploit the
	fact that we have both information from results from national exams
	and from continuous assessment in class. Controlling for family
	background, we find a positive but modest effect of resource
	quantity such as teacher hours per pupil, on pupil achievement.
	Observable teacher qualifications, within the variation present in
	lower secondary school in Norway, do not appear to have significant
	effects on school results. Resource quality as measured by teacher
	characteristics does not appear to have a significant impact on
	pupils’ marks. We find clear evidence of compensating resource
	allocation and teacher sorting as well as relative setting of
	marks.

Classification-JEL: H20; H21; H43; J22
Abstract: We use a CGE model to estimate the social cost of a marginal
	increase in public expenditure in Norway. Norway exemplifies an
	economy with high taxes. Distortionary taxes imply wedges between
	the market prices and the corresponding shadow prices. The shadow
	prices are unobservable, which is the rationale for using a CGE
	model to estimate the social cost of government consumption. The
	social cost is decomposed into a direct resource cost and the cost
	of public funds. The CGE estimate of the direct resource cost is
	implicitly a weighted average of different opportunity costs,
	reflecting distortions in the Norwegian economy. Our estimate of
	the resource cost equals about ¾ of the ex ante market price of the
	resources consumed. This gap is due to a positive labour supply
	response combined with a high effective tax rate on labour income.
	Our estimate of the social cost of raising public funds through a
	higher pay-roll tax is about 20 percent of the direct resource
	cost.

	assumptions of short sale constraints. This result is sustained
	even in a no-tax regime. To induce a substantial change from

	is needed. An alternative; taxation of capital gains from housing
	investment; could actually increase the relative holding of

Keywords: Economic performance; environmental performance; environmental

Classification-JEL: Q25; Q28; K23
Abstract: It has been claimed that good environmental performance can
	improve firms’ economic performance. However, because of e.g. data
	limitations, the methods applied in most previous quantitative
	empirical studies of the relationship between environmental and
	economic performance of firms suffer from several shortcomings. We
	discuss these shortcomings and conclude that previously applied
	methods are unsatisfactory as support for a conclusion that it pays
	for firms to be green. Then we illustrate the effects of these
	shortcomings by performing several regression analyses of the
	relationship between environmental and economic performance using a
	panel data set of Norwegian plants. A simple correlation analysis
	confirms the positive association between our measures of
	environmental and economic performance. The result prevails when we
	control for firm characteristics like e.g. size or sub-industry in
	a pooled regression. However, the result could still be biased by
	omitted unobserved variables like management or technology. When we
	control for unobserved plant specific characteristics in a panel
	regression, the effect is no longer statistically significant.
	Hence, greener plants perform economically better, but the analysis
	provides no support for the claim that it is because they are
	greener. These empirical findings further indicate that a
	conclusion that it pays to be green is premature.

	competition is by far the most important factor. This may have
	implications for the future development in costs as the effect of
	increased upstream competition is temporary and likely to weaken a
	lot sooner than effects from learning and technological change. On
	the other hand, the increased competition could also spur more

Abstract: The effects on the degree of equality of reforms in indirect
	taxation are analysed by using a microsimulation model of the
	Norwegian economy subsequent to a CGE model. The two main reforms
	studied are substitution of a uniform VAT rate on all goods and
	services and substitution of the non-uniform Norwegian VAT reform
	of 2001 for the previous, differentiated system. A main
	characteristic of the non-uniform reform is the halving of the VAT
	rate on food. All reforms are made public revenue neutral by
	changes in the VAT rate. Producer prices, pre-tax nominal incomes,
	wealth and transfers are all exogenous in the microsimulation
	model. In this paper we feed percentage changes in corresponding
	variables from the CGE model into the microsimulation model in
	order to enrich the microsimulation analyses. The non-uniform VAT
	reform leads to a clear increase in equality while the change in
	equality concerning the uniform reform is close to 0. With the
	uniform VAT reform, as opposed to the non-uniform, decompositions
	show that taking CGE effects into account has a large impact on the
	degree of equality. Changed producer prices and changed pre-tax
	nominal incomes, wealth and transfers both contribute to this.

Abstract: The relationship between the concept of option value in the

	paper we clarify Fisher’s argument by drawing on the article by
	Hanemann (1989), whereby we find the conditions for the
	Arrow-Fisher-Henry-Hanemann (AFHH) and the Dixit-Pindyck (DP)
	option value concepts to coincide or not. The main point is that
	the AFHH option value is derived under the assumption that
	investment does not take place in the first period, neither in the
	closed-loop nor in the open-loop strategy, whereas the analysis of
	the DP option value is based on the assumption that investment in
	the open-loop strategy takes place in the first period.

	increasing household recycling efforts is agreeing that recycling
	is a pleasant activity in itself, which may be interpreted as a
	warm-glow effect. The most important variable reducing household
	recycling is the opportunity cost of time spent recycling. We find
	no evidence of crowding-out of intrinsic motivation when recycling
	is perceived as mandatory. On the contrary, we find that

Title: Sectoral Labor Supply, Choice Restrictions and Functional Form

Keywords: Labor supply; non-convex budget sets; non-pecuniary
	job-attributes; sector-specific wages.
Classification-JEL: J22; C51
Abstract: In this paper we discuss a general framework for analyzing labor
	supply behavior in the presence of complicated budget- and quantity
	constraints of which some are unobserved. The individual’s labor
	supply decision is viewed as a choice from a set of discrete
	alternatives (jobs). These jobs are characterized by attributes
	such as hours of work, sector specific wages and other sector
	specific aspects of the jobs. We focus in particular on the
	theoretical justification of functional form assumptions and
	properties of the random components of the model. The labor supply
	model for married women is estimated on Norwegian data. Wage
	elasticities and the outcome of a tax reform analysis show that
	overall labor supply is moderately elastic, but these modest
	overall responses shadow for much stronger inter-sectoral changes.
	Our structural model, with a detailed specification of job
	opportunities, is compared empirically with a model in which the
	utility is approximated with a series expansion. It turns out that
	the performance of our model is at least as good as the labor
	supply model with flexible preferences.

Title: Energy Taxation in a Small, Open Economy: Efficiency Gains under
	Political Restraints
Author-Name: Geir H. Bjertnæs and Taran Fæhn

Keywords: Energy taxes; Electricity markets; Competitiveness; Compensation;
	CGE models
Classification-JEL: F41; H21: Q43; Q48
Abstract: Welfare analyses of energy taxes typically show that systems with
	uniform rates perform better than differentiated systems,
	especially if revenue increases can be recycled via cuts in more
	distortionary taxes. However, in the practical policy debates, the
	scope for efficiency gains is traded against industrial concerns. A
	major explanation to the widespread use of exemptions in energy tax
	systems has to be sought in the fact that energy-dependent
	industries tend to constitute powerful lobby groups. Presumably,
	energy-dependent industries of small, open economies will suffer
	relatively strongly if taxed, and compensating them will be costly.
	This CGE study of the case of equalising the Norwegian electricity
	tax shows that compensating the energy-intensive export industries
	is surprisingly modest. It is explained by the role of the Nordic
	electricity market, which is still limited enough to respond to
	national energy tax reforms. Thus, electricity price reductions
	partly neutralise the direct impact of the tax on profits. We also
	examine the effects of different compensation schemes and find
	significant compensation cost reductions when the scheme is
	designed to release productivity gains.

Abstract: We analyse empirical errors observed in historical population
	forecasts produced by statistical agencies in 14 European countries
	since 1950. The focus is on forecasts for three demographic
	variables: fertility (Total Fertility Rate - TFR), mortality (life
	expectancy at birth), and migration (net migration). We inspect
	forecast bias and forecast accuracy in the historical forecasts, as
	well as the distribution of the errors. Finally, we analyse for
	each of the three variables correlation patterns in forecast errors
	across countries and, for mortality, the correlation between errors
	for men and women. In the second part of the report we use time
	series model to construct prediction intervals to 2050 for the TFR,
	the life expectancy for men and women, and net migration in 18
	European countries. GARCH models are used for fertility and
	mortality, while net migration is modelled as an autoregressive

Abstract: We apply a multi-equation dynamic econometric model on monthly
	data to test if the behaviour of OPEC as a whole or different
	sub-groups of the cartel is consistent with the characteristics of
	dominant producers on the world crude oil market in the period
	1973-2001. Our results indicate that the producers outside OPEC can
	be described as competitive producers, taking the oil price as
	given and maximising profits. The OPEC members do not fit the
	behaviour of price-taking producers. Our findings of low residual
	demand price elasticities for OPEC underpin the potential market
	power of the producer group, and are in line with the results in
	some recent energy studies. On the other hand, our findings
	indicate that neither OPEC nor different sub-groups of the cartel
	can be characterised as a dominant producer in the period
	1973-1994. However, we find that the characteristics of a dominant
	producer to some extent fit OPEC-Core as from 1994. Thus, although
	OPEC clearly has affected the market price, the producer group has
	not behaved as a pure profitmaximising dominant producer.

Classification-JEL: D58; O11; Q25; Q28; Q48
Abstract: According to the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) literature,
	several mechanisms within rich economies, including increased
	willingness to conduct abatement policies, contribute to reduce
	environmental problems. Unilateral environmental policies in open
	economies may affect other countries negatively through trade
	inter-linkages. A relocation of dirty production and environmental
	pressure to economies with laxer abatement regimes can be one of
	many explanations to the apparent EKCs for rich countries. Further,
	the economic costs of national abatement policies may to some
	extent be shared with foreigners, both through lower demand for
	imports and through market share losses for foreign competitors
	producing cleaner products. In this paper, we quantify the effects
	of endogenous carbon tax policy in a rich and open economy, Norway,
	by means of a CGE model. We find that the environmental benefits
	fall and the economic costs rise when a global rather than a
	national perspective is employed.

Classification-JEL: C42; C13; C15
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of estimating the population
	total in two-stage cluster sampling when cluster sizes are unknown,
	making use of a population model arising basically from a variance
	component model. The problem can be considered as one of predicting
	the unobserved part Z of the total, and the concept of predictive
	likelihood is studied. Prediction intervals and a predictor for the
	population total are derived for the normal case, based on
	predictive likelihood. The predictor obtained from the predictive
	likelihood is shown to be approximately uniformly optimal for large
	sample size and large number of clusters, in the sense of uniformly
	minimizing the mean square error in a partially linear class of
	model-unbiased predictors. Three prediction intervals for Z based
	on three similar predictive likelihoods are studied. For a small
	number n0 of sampled clusters they differ significantly, however,
	for large n0 the three intervals are practically identical.
	Model-based and design-based coverage properties of the prediction
	intervals are studied based on a comprehensive simulation study.
	Roughly, the simulation study indicates that for large sample sizes
	the coverage measures achieve approximately the nominal level 1 - á
	and are slightly less than 1 - á for moderately large sample sizes.
	For small sample sizes the coverage measures are about 95% of the
	nominal level.

Keywords: Unemployment; Employment; Poverty

Abstract: A link between lack of employment and poverty is often made

	manner. We would therefore like to ask the question: to what extent
	does acquiring employment increase a poor household’s probability
	of exiting poverty? Register data from the entire resident
	population of Norway serves as the basis for this analysis, which
	indicates that full-time does greatly increase the probability of
	exiting poverty. Part-time employment also has an effect, albeit a
	small one. Findings with respect to transfers are compatible with
	certain disincentives related to employment for single mothers,
	although similar results cannot be found for other types of
	households.

Abstract: The present paper investigates effects of regulatory inspections
	on compliance and emissions of energy intensive manufacturing

	probability of inspection reduces the probability of violation.
	This is in line with previous studies, and may appear as an
	encouraging evaluation of the practiced regulatory enforcement
	policy. However, the direct environmental impact of the enforcement
	policy is more dubious: Regression analyses reveal a positive
	relationship between the probability of an inspection and
	emissions. It appears puzzeling that increased probability of
	inspection can yield both reduced probability of violation and
	higher emissions. The possibility that such a puzzle evolves from
	incentives inherent in the practiced regulatory policy is
	discussed.

Abstract: Governments that pursue welfare and equalization goals frequently
	target cash transfers to individuals that suffer from limited
	economic opportunities and poverty. To achieve the desired
	allocation of welfare benefits, evaluation of individual needs is
	thus required. However, the political support for redistribution
	may vary across communities and governments, depending on ideology
	of the dominant political parties, political power of interest
	groups, and geographic, cultural and social diversity within the
	community. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the allocation
	of social assistance to individuals by local governments in Norway.
	Available data on individual characteristics as well as variables
	at the municipal level allow us to separate the impact of
	individual needs from the impact of different local government
	treatment. The results show that priorities across individuals are
	affected by characteristics that capture individual economic
	opportunities and needs, whereas theories that suggest different
	priorities between local governments find little support.

Classification-JEL: D1 D9 J1
Abstract: The paper discusses the importance of decreasing mortality in
	explaining demographic change over the last century. A two-sex
	overlapping generations model is used where care both for children
	and the elderly is modeled. Assuming that the main costs of care
	are tied to time use (and thereby fairly invariant to income
	changes), the paper illustrates how exogenous changes in mortality,
	the cost of children and the bargaining power of women can explain
	fluctuations in both the level and timing of births. The
	interaction between declining mortality and the expansion of care
	for the elderly is of special importance. As a consequence,
	mortality affects fertility differently according to how much the
	government sector has expanded and how much human capital has been
	accumulated. At an early development stage, when public care is
	little developed, the effect of decreasing mortality on fertility
	is found to be positive, while at a later stage, with higher levels
	of public care, the effect is found to be negative.

Abstract: In the 1960s, Norway lagged behind its Scandinavian neighbors in
	the aggregate value of economic production per capita, as it had
	for decades. By the 1990s, Norway had caught up with and forged
	ahead of Denmark and Sweden. When and why did Norway catch up? The
	discovery and extraction of oil in the early 70s is usually
	suggested as the explanation. But oil alone cannot explain Norway's
	growth since Sachs and Warner (2001) show that resource-gifts often
	reverse growth, making oil a curse not a blessing. Moreover, there
	is the possibility of contracting the Dutch Disease, which involves
	a rapid and substantial contraction of the traded goods sector.
	This article explains how deliberate macroeconomic policy, the
	arrangement of political and economic institutions, a strong
	judicial system, and social norms contributed to let Norway escape
	the Resource Curse and the Dutch Disease for more than two decades.
	Intriguingly, it appears that Norway in the late 90s may show some
	symptoms. Norway experiences reversed relative growth compared to
	Denmark and Sweden and a contraction of industrial activity. This
	article explores the political economy behind this recent
	slow-down.

Abstract: All Annex B parties but Russia, Australia and USA, have ratified

	This paper therefore analyzes consequences of some proposed
	alternatives if the Russians decide not to ratify. The paper
	focuses on two cases where a limited number of the remaining Annex
	B parties respond to Russian withdrawal by the establishment of a
	new "mini-Kyoto" agreement whereby these parties commit themselves
	to the emission caps, the rules for emissions trading, compliance
	etc. set out in the Protocol. Environmentally, implementation of
	the Kyoto Protocol without participation from Russia and Ukraine is
	obviously superior to implementation with Russian/Ukrainian
	participation, due to the implied withdrawal of hot air based
	permits from the market. Implementation of the Kyoto Protocol
	without Russian/Ukrainian participation will, furthermore, imply
	higher costs to the remaining countries. This paper provides
	estimates of the permit price and environmental benefits that are
	likely if the proposed "mini-Kyoto" agreements are implemented.

Keywords: Rational addiction; Euler equation
Classification-JEL: D11; D12; I10
Abstract: The econometric implementation of rational addiction theory has
	been highly influenced by Becker, Grossman and Murphy (BGM). They
	specify an Euler equation where current consumption is determined
	by current price and past and future consumption. This model is
	claimed to be able to discriminate between rational addictive,
	myopic addictive, and non-addictive behavior. However, as
	demonstrated in this paper, the coefficients of the Euler equation
	are not structural parameters. Provided that two implausible
	assumptions do not hold, the Euler equation coefficients for the
	rational addict are shown to be non-constant. But even when these
	assumptions are assumed to be valid, the coefficients of the Euler
	equation will vary under the alternative hypothesis of myopic
	addiction. Moreover, and in contrast to the common interpretation,
	BGM's non-addicted consumer is influenced by past consumption,
	implying that a rational and a myopic non-addict behave
	differently. These problems makes it unclear how analyses based on
	the BGM approach can support, or reject, rational addiction theory.

Abstract: Many economists maintain that environmental regulations hamper
	productivity growth. However, recently, an opposing view has gained
	advocates. Indeed, it has been suggested that the empirically
	detected inverse relationship between environmental regulations and
	productivity growth is an almost inevitable consequence of the
	current methods used to measure productivity – methods that fail to
	account for improvements in environmental performance. We apply a
	method that amends this methodological shortcoming of previous
	empirical studies, and perform a regression analysis of regulatory
	stringency and a measure of productivity growth that accounts for
	emission reductions. To credit a firm for emission reductions, we
	include emissions as inputs when calculating the Malmquist
	productivity index (EMI); and for the sake of comparison, we also
	calculate the traditional Malmquist productivity index (MI) where
	emissions are not included. The regression analysis shows that the
	sign of the relationship is positive when EMI is employed as
	measure of productivity growth; but not statistically different
	from zero when MI is applied. Hence, the present paper provides the
	first empirical support for the claim that evaluations or
	recommendations of environmental policies that are based on a
	traditional measure of total factor productivity can be biased.

Abstract: This paper estimates price and GDP/income elasticities of several
	energy goods in OECD countries over 1978 to 1999 by applying the
	one-step GMM estimation method suggested by Arellano and Bond
	(1991) to a panel data set. The energy demand is specified by a
	simple partial adjustment model. We find that compared to
	conventional OLS and Within estimator, the one-step GMM estimator
	gives more intuitive results in terms of sign and magnitude. The
	results show that for electricity, natural gas and gas oil demand,
	price elasticities are in general larger (in absolute value) while
	GDP/income elasticities are lower in the residential sector than in
	the industrial sector. This paper yields lower values for price
	elasticities compared to the results from earlier studies. The
	long-run GDP/income elasticities found in this paper, however, are
	quite similar to those found in earlier studies, and are around
	unity in general.

Abstract: In this paper we analyse how oilrig activity in different
	Non-OPEC regions is affected by the crude oil price. Oilrig
	activity outside OPEC is an important indicator for production in
	the near future, and is more sensitive to the oil price than
	production from existing fields. We estimate relationships between
	oilrig activity and crude oil prices using Equilibrium Correction
	Models (ECM) augmented with a stochastic time trend. The results
	generally show a positive relationship between oilrig activity and
	the crude oil price, but the strength of the relationship differs
	across regions. Rig activity in the US seems to react much faster
	and stronger to oil price changes compared to other regions. In the
	long-run the price elasticity in the US is above 1.5. Half the
	effect is observed after six months. In other regions the long-run
	elasticity is mainly between 0.5 and 1. Overall, it seems to be a
	clear relationship between the oil industry structure in the region
	and the reaction to price changes.

Abstract: We study the relationship between industrial competitiveness,
	adaption of cleaner production techniques and environmental policy.
	While other contributions have analyzed environmental innovations
	with point of departure in the polluting firm, we introduce an
	up-stream market for new pollution abatement technology. A strong
	environmental policy may then benefit industrial competitiveness
	through its effect on the price on pollution abatement. However,
	the incentive for a stringent policy partly disappears if there is
	a global market for pollution abatement solutions, and
	environmental policy is set simultaneously in several countries. In
	our analysis we hope to draw attention to an often overlooked
	issue. The diffusion of new pollution abatement techniques often

Title: Agricultural Production with Uncertain Water Supply

Author-Workplace-Name: Statistics Norway

	constraints; Continuous random utility model; Leontief technology.
Classification-JEL: D21; N50
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to develop a framework for analysis
	of multioutput agricultural production when the supply of water is
	uncertain. Specifically, we assume that the farmer operates as if
	the decision process takes place in two stages. In stage one the
	farmer decides how much land to allocate to each crop. However, in
	this stage he is uncertain about the supply of water during the
	growth period before harvest. In the second stage when the
	uncertainty is revealed he adjusts the quantities of (ex-post)
	input factors (given the allocation in the first stage). The
	production technology is assumed to be of the Leontief type. We
	also extend the model to the case with several seasons where one
	crop is cultivated throughout all season while the remaining crops
	are seasonal-specific. The empirical model is extended to allow for
	a particular version of bounded rationality in which the farmer is
	allowed to make optimization error. This implies that the
	estimation procedure is considerably simplified.

Abstract: There is considerable interest in identifying the magnitude of
	the difference between increases in CPI and costs-of-living, and
	this article uses the technique proposed by Hamilton (2001) to
	measure this discrepancy for Norway for the 90s. The method is
	extended along several dimensions by introducing a framework in
	which measurement errors are modelled. A non-parametric approach is
	then employed to segment households into demographic types while
	allowing for flexibility in costs-of-living increases for different
	standards. Hamilton finds that American CPI overstates
	costs-of-living in the U.S. for the period 1974-1991, Norwegian
	results for 1990-1999 indicate that CPI sometimes may understate
	costs-of-living, perhaps because of a credit-financed boom in house
	prices. The Norwegian CPI rose 22 percent in the period, but the
	general consumer behaved as if costs-of-living increased more than
	35 percent. For some segments of society, for example single-person
	households, the increase was substantially larger, suggesting
	potentially important distributional effects.

Keywords: Population Ageing; Fiscal Sustainability; Labour Supply;
	Computable General Equilibrium
Classification-JEL: D58; H31; H50; J22
Abstract: Most studies on the economic consequences of ageing rely on
	Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models that account for
	feedback mechanisms through changes in relative prices, tax bases
	etc. However, since individual labour supply behaviour is
	considered to be a key element in CGE-analyses of fiscal
	sustainability problems, the results of these analyses may depend
	crucially on how the labour supply behaviour is modelled. The
	current practice of combining a simplified representation of the
	tax and transfer system with the labour supply behaviour of a few
	representative agents may render a misleading description of
	incentives and revenue effects. The purpose of this paper is to
	demonstrate the importance of using an alternative strategy by
	integrating a detailed microeconometric model of labour supply,
	that is sufficiently flexible to capture a large variety of labour
	supply responses, with a large-scale CGE model. The integrated
	micro-macro CGE model is employed to explore how endogenous
	household labour supply behaviour affects and interacts with
	sustainability problems in Norway. The empirical results suggest
	that the required increase in the future tax burden is less
	dramatic when the analysis allows for a flexible representation of
	the labour supply behaviour. Moreover, by replacing the current
	progressive tax system with a flat tax system it is found that the
	pressure on future public finances is significantly reduced.

Keywords: Global warming; Emission scenarios; IPCC; PPP.
Classification-JEL: : Q30; Q41
Abstract: Ian Castles and David Henderson have criticized IPCC’s Special
	Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) (IPCC, 2000) for using market
	exchange rates (MER) instead of purchasing power parities (PPP)
	when converting regional GDP into a common denominator. The
	consequence is that poor countries generally appear to be poorer
	than they actually are. An overstated income gap between rich and
	poor countries in the base year gives rise to projections of too
	high economic growth in the poor countries because the scenarios
	are constructed with the aim of reducing the income gap. Castles
	and Henderson claim that overstated economic growth means that
	greenhouse gas emissions are overstated as well. However, because
	closure of the emission intensity gap between the rich and the poor
	parts of the world is another important driving force in the
	scenarios, we argue that the use of MER in the SRES scenarios has
	not caused an overestimation of the global emission growth because
	the two types of errors effectively neutralize one another.

Classification-JEL: C13; C23; D24; E22; M40
Abstract: We propose a new method for estimating capital stocks at the firm
	level by combining business accounts information and investment
	data. The method also produces capital estimates at the sector or
	industry level by summing individual firms' capital stocks and
	appropriately inflating this sum to account for firms with missing
	data. Our approach has two major advantages compared with the much
	used Perpetual Inventory Method (PIM). First, long investment
	series are not necessary. Second, sector capital estimates are
	automatically adjusted for changes in the capital stock because of
	entry and exit of firms. While capital growth rates in Norwegian
	manufacturing were only 1 percent on average during 1993--2004
	according to national accounts figures, our method yields much
	higher growth rates of 5.5 percent on average.

Abstract: In recent decades new technology has led to increasing demand for
	well-educated labour at the expense of labour with lower education
	levels. Moreover, increased imports from low-cost countries have
	squeezed out many Norwegian manufacturing firms employing a
	sizeable share of workers with low education. In this article a
	large macroeconomic model for Norway (MODAG) is used to quantify
	the importance that technological developments and competition from
	low-cost countries have had for the economy and for low- and
	high-educated labour. The results show that above all technological
	developments, but also increased trade with low-cost countries,
	have reduced demand for low-educated labour relative to
	well-educated labour. Wage formation factors have however meant a)
	that technological developments have also benefited those with low
	education who still hold a job, and b) that a relative fall in
	prices on goods from poor parts of the world has kept down wage
	differentials.

Abstract: This article uses the Case-Shiller technique for constructing

	the period 1991-2002 consisting of 10 376 pairs of repeated sales.
	Using a weighted least squares scheme in order to control for
	heteroskedasticity, we construct a general housing price index by
	regressing differences in log prices for the subset of repeated
	sales of same, and thus identical, homes onto a set of binary time
	variables, one for each quarter in the period. The constructed
	index shows that nominal prices for identical homes in general have
	increased by a factor of 3.58 over the 11-year period, while the
	CPI increased by 1.28, creating substantial capital returns for
	early purchasers. We then segment the data set into five different
	housing types in order to control for finite mixtures of hedonic
	features, and find that price indices for the smallest and largest
	type show nominal increases by factors 4.40 and 2.77, respectively.

Classification-JEL: C22; N10; O10; Q33
Abstract: Growth studies show, counter to intuition, that the discovery of
	a natural resource may be a curse rather than a blessing since
	resource-rich countries grow slower than others. But it has been
	suggested that Norway may be an important exception to the curse
	and that the curse does not afflict rich countries. This article
	addresses both issues, and introduces a new diagnostic test.
	Neighbor countries Denmark and Sweden are used to highlight
	Norway's relative development and to test for curse presence. I
	employ a structural break technique to demonstrate that Norway
	started an acceleration in the early 70s, after having discovered
	oil in 1969, and did not experience a pronounced retardation for
	the next 25 years. Instead, after first catching-up with its
	neighbors, Norway maintained a higher pace of growth. Norway might
	have escaped the curse. However, data suggest a slow-down at the
	end of the period, opening the possibility of a late onset of the
	curse. If so, rich countries are not immune.

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to define various
	mean-spread-preserving transformations, which can be considered as
	generalized versions of the mean-Gini-preserving transformation.
	The mean-Gini-preserving transformation, which was introduced
	independently by Zoli (1997, 2002) and Aaberge (2000b), is a
	combination of progressive and regressive transfers that leaves the
	Gini coefficient unchanged. It will be demonstrated that the
	various mean-spread-preserving transformations form a useful basis
	for judging the normative significance of two alternative sequences
	of nested Lorenz dominance criteria that can be used to rank Lorenz
	curves in situations where the Lorenz curves intersect. The two
	alternative sequences of Lorenz dominance criteria suggest two
	alternative strategies for increasing the number of Lorenz curves
	that can be strictly ordered; one that places more emphasis on
	changes that occur in the lower part of the income distribution and
	the other that places more emphasis on changes that occur in the
	upper part of the income distribution. Furthermore, it is
	demonstrated that the sequences of dominance criteria characterize
	two separate systems of nested subfamilies of inequality measures
	and thus provide a method for identifying the least restrictive
	social preferences required to reach an unambiguous ranking of a
	given set of Lorenz curves. Scaling up the introduced Lorenz
	dominance relations of this paper by the mean income ì and
	replacing the rank-dependent measures of inequality JP with the
	rank-dependent social welfare functions WP = m(1- JP), it can be
	demonstrated that the present results also apply to the generalized
	Lorenz curve and moreover provide convenient characterizations of
	the corresponding social welfare orderings.

	information affecting participants’ beliefs about the degree to
	which the observers are contributors is introduced. The data
	suggests that indirect social sanctions from monetarily unaffected
	observers can increase voluntary contributions to public goods,
	provided that the subjects have reason to believe that the

Abstract: Although environmental regulations may imply a cost increase on

	index approach on micro data for the Norwegian pulp and paper
	industry, and find that the overall productivity growth accounting
	for changes in emissions of COD to water is higher than the growth
	in the productivity measure including conventional inputs only. We
	find the opposite result when including emissions of acids and
	climate gases to air. This is probably due to environmental
	regulations with opposing effects on different emissions. A
	decomposition of the Malmquist index into a technical efficiency
	change factor and a technical change component shows that the

Classification-JEL:  
Abstract: China is a dominant energy consumer in a global context and
	current energy forecasts emphasise that China’s future energy
	consumption also will rely heavily on coal. The coal use is the
	major source of the greenhouse gas CO2 and particles causing
	serious health damage. This paper looks into the question if coal
	washing might work as low cost strategy for both CO2 and particle
	emission reductions. Coal washing removes dirt and rock from raw
	coal, resulting in a coal product with higher thermal energy and
	less air pollutants. Coal cleaning capacity has so far not been
	developed in line with the market potential. In this paper an
	emerging market for cleaned coal is studied within a CGE model for
	China. The macro approach catches the repercussions of coal
	cleaning through increased energy efficiency, lower coal
	transportation costs and crowding out effect of investments in coal
	washing plants. Coal cleaning stimulates economic growth and
	reduces particle emissions, but total energy use, coal use and CO2
	emissions increase through a rebound effect supported by the vast
	reserve of underemployed labourers. A carbon tax on fossil fuel
	combustion has a limited effect on total emissions. The reason is a
	coal leakage to tax exempted processing industries.

Abstract: The paper estimates the output of the Norwegian higher education

	income that can be attributed to the education “produced” in a
	given year. As opposed to JF, our output measure excludes the value
	of non-market labour activities. We provide a theoretical rationale
	for this modification of the JF-methodology, which has a great
	negative impact on the output estimates. Our baseline estimate of
	value added in the Norwegian higher education sector is still more
	than 8 times higher than the corresponding figure in the Norwegian
	National Accounts (NA). Replacing the standard NA figures by our
	estimate raises the share of higher education in GDP from 1.0 to

Abstract: The paper analyses how a tractable representation of productivity
	heterogeneity among firms modifies the standard Dixit-Stiglitz (DS)
	model of monopolistic competition. The properties of the asymmetric
	model are explored by comparative statics analysis. The equilibrium
	adjustments of industry aggregates, such as the number of firms,
	output and the productivity of variable inputs are compared with
	the corresponding adjustments in the symmetric model. The analysis
	thereby clarifies when and why the standard DS model may provide a
	misleading picture of the aggregate industry behaviour. A
	by-product of the paper is to demonstrate that a more realistic
	description of a basic aspect of technology heterogeneity can be
	taken into account at a relatively low cost in terms of reduced
	tractability.

Title: On the Price and Volume Effects from Green Certificates in the

Keywords: Green certificates; energy market model; new instruments
Classification-JEL: Q41; Q42; Q48; H23; H30
Abstract: We present a model for an energy market that includes a green
	certificate for suppliers of energy from renewables and a purchaser
	commitment to buy these certificates. We show that price and volume
	effects in the energy market are ambigous under a wide range of
	alternative levels of the purchaser commitment. We calibrate our
	model to data for the Norwegian economy. Simulations shows a
	downward movement in energy prices as the government starts
	increasing the level of the purchaser commitment. This implies that
	the producer of ordinary energy pays for the restriction in the
	market while energy consumption and consumer surplus increases.
	When the purchaser commitment increases above a certain level, the
	purchaser price increases and the volume effect is negative.
	Although the effects are sensitive to elasticities of demand and
	supply of both technologies, the main results are robust against a
	variety of combinations of elasticities. The article discusses
	effects both under autarky and free trade of both energy and green
	certificates. The results vary denpendent upon whether only one or
	a majority of actual countires introduces a domestic market or
	allows for international trade both in energy and the green
	certificate instrument.

Classification-JEL: C33; D21; L61
Abstract: Although most production activities involve multiple outputs,
	econometric models of production or cost functions normally involve
	only one single homogeneous output. The aim of this paper is to
	test the hypothesis that a multiproduct specification is superior
	to a model with a single homogenous product. To do this, we use a
	Multiproduct Symmetric Generalized McFadden (MSGM) cost function.
	This functional form is globally concave and flexible in the sense
	that it provides a second order differentiable approximation of any
	arbitrary cost function which is twice continuously differentiable
	and linear homogenous in input prices. In an empirical application
	on a panel data from ten Norwegian primary aluminium plants, we
	find support for our hypothesis. We present estimates of price
	elasticities, returns to scale and scope, and product specific
	demand elasticities. Our results indicate economies of scope, i.e.
	it is more profitable to produce more than one output, and show
	sensitivity of factor demand when the product mix changes.

Abstract: After the U.S. and Australian withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol,
	and the extension of national quotas in the Bonn- and
	Marrakesh-agreements, meager environmental effects and a low price
	of emission permits is likely to be the outcome of implementation.
	This paper provides an analysis of these prospects for the Kyoto
	Protocol and the international permit market based on different
	assumptions related to the baseline scenario. Possible strategic
	behavior in the permit market is emphasized: A contribution of the
	paper is to take into consideration potential conflicting Russian
	interests in the market for natural gas in Europe and the market
	for emission permits under the Kyoto Protocol. The Russian
	Federation is a large supplier with the potential for exercising
	market power in both these markets. The analysis shows that the
	Russian interests in the gas market may lead Russia to increase
	export of emission allowances and consequently contribute to a low
	permit price. The applied analytical tool is a partial equilibrium
	model of the market for emission allowances and the fossil fuel
	markets.

Classification-JEL: D12; Q41
Abstract: Liberalisation of the Norwegian electricity market has given more
	short-term variation in the electricity price. Since almost three
	quarters of Norwegian households have heating equipment using more
	than one energy carrier, we would expect them to be able to hedge
	from price increases and benefit from low prices by switching
	between energy carriers. In many studies estimates of the cross
	price derivatives in Norwegian residential energy consumption give
	a negative sign. The question is whether hedging is possible
	despite this negative sign, that is, if energy goods are
	alternatives and not separable in consumption. To answer this
	question, we estimate a conditional demand model on a sample of
	2438 households to decompose the cross price derivatives. We find
	that the negative cross price derivatives are mainly due to budget
	effects. We also reject the hypothesis of weak separability,
	indicating that Norwegian households are able to hedge from energy
	price variations.

Abstract: Information about total electricity consumption is available for
	most households. However, the electricity consumption related to
	different end uses, e.g. space heating, water heating, lighting and
	services from household appliances are usually not metered.
	Metering data are very costly to achieve, and in this paper we
	study two methods for end-use estimation, which can be applied on
	household data for appliance holdings, demographic and economic
	variables. The first method is the engineering model which has been
	used to calculate the so far only documented Norwegian end-use
	results applied on data from a Norwegian energy survey. The second
	method is an econometric conditional demand model applied on data
	from the same survey. We compare the numerical results from the two
	models and give some recommendations regarding choice of end-use
	approach and what questions to implement in household surveys
	designed to disaggregate electricity consumption.

Abstract: We consider a Seemingly Unrelated Time Series Equations framework

	We test for demand homogeneity within a specification where the
	static linear Almost Ideal Demand system is augmented by three
	stochastic trends and three stochastic seasonal variables. The
	homogeneity restriction is rejected for about half of the
	commodities and in the system as a whole using conventional
	significance levels. However, when comparing the out-of-sample
	predictions from a homogeneous and non-homogeneous model, we do not
	find that the non-homogenous model performs better than the
	homogeneous one. Moreover, the income and price elasticities
	calculated under homogeneity restrictions are all of the right sign
	and have reasonable magnitudes.

	characterized by attributes such as hours of work, sector specific
	wages and other sector specific aspects of the jobs. We focus in
	particular on theoretical justification of functional form
	assumptions and properties of the random components of the model.
	The paper includes an empirical application based on Norwegian

	expressed as arithmetic means can be associated with expectations,
	we consider conditions ensuring the existence and stability of
	relationships between expected inputs and expected output and
	discuss their properties. Existence conditions for and
	relationships between higher-order moments are considered. An
	empirical implementation based on panel data for two manufacturing
	industries gives decomposition and simulation results for expected

Abstract: We investigate whether the future relationships between several

	emission-augmenting effect of scaling up aggregate economic
	activity may be counteracted by greener composition of production

	environmental quality and policy. To quantify the importance of
	these central hypotheses, we use a CGE model with endogenous policy
	for Norway. Our results suggest significant future effects of all
	these three counteracting mechanisms. For most local and regional
	pollutants, they may be strong enough to prolong the falling
	emission trends. However, we cannot rely on reductions in emissions
	of climate gases and some transport-related local pollutants. Our
	results also indicate that pollution leakages abroad are likely to
	find place.

Classification-JEL: D31; H72
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to provide an evaluation of how
	local public in-kind benefits affect the distribution of income in
	Norway. To this end, a method that accounts for differences between
	municipalities in capacity to produce the same standard of public
	services is used for assessing the value of sector-specific local
	public services in each municipality. Next, the underlying
	justification of the various services is used as basis for
	determining the allocation of the assessed value of the services on
	the citizens in the municipalities. For instance, services like
	health care and care for the elderly and disabled are treated as an
	insurance arrangement. Thus, the corresponding in-kind benefits are
	allocated on the potential recipients. By contrast, the value of
	the production of education and child care is allocated uniformly
	on the families that receive these services. The empirical results
	show that the inequality in the (marginal) distribution of
	municipal in-kind benefits is rather high. The contribution of
	in-kind benefits to inequality in the distribution of extended
	income (cash (after-tax) income plus municipal in-kind benefits)
	is, however, approximately neutral. This result is due to the fact
	that elderly people and families with children receive the largest
	share of the municipal in-kind benefits and moreover are located in
	the central part of the distribution of extended income.

Abstract: In conducting economic policy, governments generally face
	conflicts in various objectives, e.g. between efficiency and
	equity. In Norway, one objective of energy politics has been to
	reduce electricity consumption, and several tax increases have been
	proposed. Whether this objective may be in conflict with objectives
	of efficiency and equity is the focus in this paper. We discuss the
	effects on household behaviour of three different electricity tax
	schemes, one proportional and two non-linear. For each household we
	estimate the reduction in household electricity consumption. As
	measures of distributional effects and efficiency effects we
	estimate compensating variation and excess tax burden from the tax
	schemes. We find that the non-linear tax scheme targeting high
	electricity consumption is most preferred in order to reduce
	consumption and least preferred concerning the objective of
	minimizing excess tax burden. When considering distributional
	effects, the ranking of tax schemes depends on the weight placed on
	different household groups.

Classification-JEL: H21; O13; Q40
Abstract: During the last decade, Norway has carried out an ambitious
	climate policy. The main policy tool is a relatively high carbon
	tax, which was implemented already in 1991. Data for the
	development in CO2 emissions since then provide a unique
	opportunity to evaluate carbon taxes as a policy tool. To reveal
	the driving forces behind the changes in the three most important
	climate gases, CO2, methane and N2O in the period 1990-1999, we
	decompose the actually observed emissions changes, and use an
	applied general equilibrium simulation to look into the specific
	effect of carbon taxes. Although total emissions have increased, we
	find a significant reduction in emissions per unit of GDP over the
	period due to reduced energy intensity, changes in the energy mix
	and reduced process emissions. Despite considerable taxes and price
	increases for some fuel-types, the carbon tax effect has been
	modest. While the partial effect from lower energy intensity and
	energy mix changes was a reduction in CO2 emissions of 14 percent,
	the carbon taxes contributed to only 2 percent reduction. This
	relatively small effect relates to extensive tax exemptions and
	relatively inelastic demand in the sectors in which the tax is
	actually implemented.

Abstract: This paper reports on price formation in experimental markets in
	which a single seller trades with four buyers. Transactions occur
	if either a buyer accepts an offer to sell from the seller, or the
	seller accepts an offer to buy from a buyer. The dissemination of
	such offers is endogenous in that the seller determines which
	buyer(s) should be informed about offers to sell, whereas each
	buyer may broadcast his offer to buy to any of the residual buyers.
	Complete dissemination of offers is consistent with conventional
	double-auction trading rules. The result is two-fold. First, the
	diffusion of trading information is incomplete, in that neither the
	single seller nor the buyers inform all market participants about
	offers. Second, observed prices and the number of transactions are
	in line with the competitive theoretic benchmark.

Classification-JEL: H24; H31; J22
Abstract: The inequality in pre-tax income increases in Norway in the
	1990s, while the distribution of taxes is about unaltered. This
	means that tax progressivity has decreased in the period, as
	measured by summary indices of tax progressivity. This paper
	discusses to what extent this observed decrease in tax
	progressivity can be explained by tax changes in the period, by
	analysing individual income data. As marginal tax rates at high
	income levels have been substantially reduced in the period, for
	instance through the tax reform of 1992, it is expected that tax
	changes may have influenced the degree of inequality in pre-tax
	incomes. This behavioral effect is examined by deriving tax
	elasticity estimates, obtained from various panel data set
	regressions. Moreover, the tax changes may also have shifted the
	distributional burden of taxes for unaltered level of pre-tax
	income inequality. In order to identify this (direct) effect of
	tax-law alterations, the same fixed distribution of pre-tax income
	is exposed to various tax-laws in the period.

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to discuss the social desirability of a

	consisted of three different fear treatments, cognitive therapy,
	applied relaxation or nitrous oxide sedation, as well as dental
	treatment. To evaluate the effects of uncertainty on the patients'
	benefits from the program, we elicit their willingness to pay both
	before and after receiving treatment, since we expected patients to
	be uncertain about the outcome of the fear treatment. We find that
	the social desirability of the treatment is very sensitive towards
	uncertainty. While only 24 percent of the patients were willing to
	pay the actual cost of the treatment before attending, 71 percent
	were willing to pay afterwards. This implies that many patients who
	would benefit from the treatment ex post are not willing to pay the
	cost of the treatment ex ante, and will thus not receive any
	treatment unless it is subsidised.

	account. I present a statistical model of repeated surveys and
	construct a computationally feasible estimator based on the Kalman
	filter. The novelty is that the estimator efficiently uses the
	whole underlying data set. However, for computational purposes, we
	only need the first and second empirical moments of the data.

Title: Eco-labels, Production Related Externalities and Trade

Keywords: Eco-labels; strategie environmental; policy; trade
Classification-JEL: H7; Q2; R3
Abstract: We analyze the trade and welfare effects of eco-labels in a
	domestic market with one domestic firm and one foreign firm.
	Pollution is production related, and the government can choose
	between including the product category in an eco-label scheme and
	setting an environmental standard. The environmental standard will
	only apply to the domestic firm, while both firms can adopt the
	eco-label. Given that the environmental damage is not too large, we
	find that it is optimal for the government to introduce an
	eco-label scheme. An eco-label scheme is optimal even though the
	domestic firm may loose profit and the foreign firm may gain.
	Hence, the eco-label scheme is not introduced for protectionist
	purposes. Further, if the government for some reason were prevented
	from using eco-labels, global, domestic and foreign welfare would
	be hampered.

Classification-JEL: C25; J22; J31
Abstract: This paper analyzes labor market behavior of urban Eritrean women
	with particular reference to the impact of education, earnings and
	labor market opportunities. Unlike traditional models of labor
	supply, which assume that work can be supplied freely in the labor
	market, we develop a framework that explicitly takes into account
	the notion of job opportunities and observable sets of feasible
	jobs. The framework is formulated within a random utility setting
	in which unobservable jobs can conveniently be treated as latent
	alternatives. The framework can also readily take into account
	observed restrictions on the sets of feasible jobs. The empirical
	estimation of the model is based on data from the labor force
	module of the 1996/97 Eritrean Household Income and Expenditure
	Survey for urban areas. We estimate structural choice probabilities
	of being in the states “Not employed”, “Working in the wage
	sector”, and “Working as self-employed”, where it is taken into
	account that some women are constrained in their labor market
	choices. We find that the effect on wages of changes in education
	level is high; improving the education levels of women greatly
	improves their wages, which again contributes to bringing more
	women into the labor force. However, our data do not support the
	assumption that basic education increases women’s job
	opportunities. In order to do so, at least secondary education is
	required.

Title: Identification, Estimation and Testing in Panel Data Models with
	Attrition: The Role of the Missing at Random Assumption

Keywords: Missing at random; non-ignorable attrition; unbalanced panel
	data; identification; pseudo likelihood; martingale.
Classification-JEL: C13; C23; C33
Abstract: This paper discusses identification, estimation and testing in
	panel data models with attrition. We focus on a situation which
	often occurs in the analysis of firms: Attrition (exit) is
	endogenous and depends on the outcomes of an observed stochastic
	process and the interest-parameters characterizing this process.
	Thus attrition is non-ignorable even if selection is based only on
	observed variables - that is, even if the missing items are missing
	at random (MAR). The likelihood function obtained by ignoring the
	attrition mechanism is a pseudo likelihood function. Assuming that
	the MAR condition holds, this paper establishes conditions for
	identification and consistent estimation based on the pseudo
	likelihood function. It is also shown that the MAR hypothesis has
	testable implications in many situations that are encountered in
	practice. Simulations suggest that in the case of the
	autoregressive model with random effects, the efficiency of the
	pseudo likelihood estimator (based on normality) is not much
	affected even by strong departures from normality. In a variety of
	simulation models, the pseudo likelihood estimator clearly
	outperforms the moment estimators - even when the latter are
	consistent.

Keywords: Experimental economics; methodology; Duhem-Quine thesis.
Classification-JEL: B41; C90
Abstract: The Duhem-Quine thesis asserts that any empirical evaluation of a
	theory is in fact a composite test of several interconnected
	hypotheses. Recalcitrant evidence signals falsity within the
	conjunction of hypotheses, but logic alone cannot pinpoint the
	individual element(s) inside the theoretical cluster responsible
	for a false prediction. This paper considers the relevance of the
	Duhem-Quine thesis for experimental economics. A starting point is
	to detail how laboratory evaluations of economic hypotheses
	constitute composite tests. Another aim is to scrutinize the
	strategy of conducting a series of experiments in order to hem in
	the source(s) of disconfirmative evidence. A Bayesian approach is
	employed to argue that reproducing experiments is not necessarily
	useful in terms of identifying correct causes of recalcitrant data.

Classification-JEL: D70; D44; C92
Abstract: This paper reports on recurring laboratory elections in which
	buyers and sellers choose institutional rules to govern a
	subsequent trading round. The bid auction (buyers propose prices),
	offer auction (sellers suggest prices) and double auction (both
	trader types initiate price quotes) make up the electoral
	candidates. Both plurality rule and approval voting are used as
	vote-counting schemes. The former allows each trader to vote for,
	at most, one auction, whereas approval voting permits voters to
	either abstain or to vote for one, two or all three institutional
	alternatives. The main result is threefold. First, plurality rule
	induces a Duverger effect in the sense that only the bid and offer
	auctions emerge as viable auctions. Approval voting instead leads
	to close three-way races with each of the three auctions winning
	approximately one third of the elections. Second, buyers (sellers)
	in the plurality-rule sessions concordantly vote for the bid
	(offer) auction. Approval-voting behavior is comparatively more
	heterogeneous. Third, bid-auction prices are significantly lower
	than double-auction prices, which again are significantly below
	offer-auction prices.

	schedule and the single seller's supply curve shift unpredictably
	between trading periods. The principal result is threefold. First,
	double-auction prices tend to be greater than offer-auction prices
	which again tend to be greater than bid-auction prices. Second, the
	listed ranking reflects tendencies only. The laboratory data do not
	support statistically significant behavioral differences between
	the three auctions. Third, trading is highly efficient regardless
	of auction type.

	that rejection of bilateral relationships may result from

Abstract: This article presents a new way of estimating latent total
	consumption in a household that may improve the accuracy of studies
	into permanent income and consumption inequality. While the
	frequently used total purchase expenditure in a household is an
	unbiased estimator of latent total household consumption, it is
	inoptimal since total purchase expenditure is an un-weighted sum of
	expenditures that contain measurement errors. We derive a competing
	estimator, unbiased and variance minimizing, based on a latent
	variable model. From estimates of error term variance among
	consumption indicators, we give accurate indicators more weight,
	and align weights to minimize variance. An advantage of the
	suggested estimator is that it allows both expenditure and
	non-expenditure indicators of latent total consumption. We
	demonstrate empirically how the minimum-variance estimator reduces
	variance, and find that on Norwegian expenditure data from 1993 the
	reduction is 44 per cent.

Abstract: We estimate Engel elasticities of housing expenditures for each

	demographic effects for housing are estimated in an
	errors-in-variables two stage least square regression model using
	random samples of Norwegian households. We find that given
	demographic composition household demand for housing seems to
	increase proportionately with total consumption, in contrast to
	other categories such as food and transportation. The empirical
	regularity between housing expenditures and total consumption
	yields forecasting potential and may represent a basic pattern of
	consumption.

Classification-JEL: D12; D31; H23; R41
Abstract: This article studies environmental and distributional effects
	from a differentiated tax system on a set of disaggregated
	transportation goods. Empirical examination on Norwegian data
	indicates that higher tax rates on high-pollution luxury modes of
	transportation such as air flights and taxis reduce inequality and
	increase the environmental quality. Lower tax rates on
	low-pollution necessary modes such as buses, bicycles, and mopeds
	reduce inequality and increase environmental quality. However,
	higher taxes on high-pollution necessities such as gasoline have
	favorable environmental effects, but increase inequality somewhat.
	Railway passenger transportation appears to be distributionally
	neutral. In order to interpret the estimates with respect to
	distributional and environmental concerns, we use a theory of
	distribution effects based on Engel, child, and adult elasticities
	and a wide range of empirical estimates of environmental hazards
	from transportation consumption. For different modes of
	transportation, we study emissions per passenger-kilometer and per
	monetary unit.

Abstract: How do firms differ, and why do they differ even within narrowly

	differences in sales, materials, labor costs and capital across
	firms can largely be summarized by a single, firm-specific, dynamic
	factor, which we label efficiency in the light of our structural
	model. The model contains the complete system of supply and factor
	demand equations. It suggests that efficiency is strongly linked to
	profitability and firm size, but it is unrelated to labor
	productivity. Our second task is to understand the origin and
	evolution of the differences in efficiency. Among the firms
	established within the 24-year period that we consider, permanent
	differences in efficiency dominate over differences generated by
	firm-specific, cumulated innovations.

Abstract: We analyse the energy flexibility and technological change in the

	three sub-sectors according to their products. Second, in each
	sub-sector our model accounts for the heterogeneity between firms.
	We apply a specific flexible cost function, which makes sure that
	the curvature conditions hold. In our model, the energy flexibility
	occurs in different ways. On one hand producers may invest in
	technologies, which make them able to switch between different
	energy sources. On the other hand they can change their output mix
	towards less energy intensive products when the energy prices
	increase.

Abstract: An applied econometric study of aggregation, based on an

	Panel data are informative in examining aggregation of variables,

	comparison of the time series properties of the exactly aggre-
	gated micro relationships with those obtained by performing
	aggregation by analogy. Numerical aggregation of Translog
	production functions for three manufacturing industries is
	considered. We show, under linear aggregation of inputs and output,
	that departures between geometric and arithmetic means of the
	inputs and correlation between the log-inputs, both their levels
	and time paths, contribute substantially to aggregation biases in
	the output volume and instability of the derived input and scale
	elasticities. Hence, the existence and stability of an approximate
	"macro Translog production function" over time can be questioned.

Abstract: Do households' recycling efforts represent a social cost, which

	since recycling efforts are to a large extent voluntary. We
	demonstrate that if the government can indirectly increase
	voluntary recycling efforts through appeals to the public or
	through similar means, then the use of these means does impose a
	cost on households. This cost can be higher or lower than the
	environmental gain resulting from the increased recycling.
	Norwegian data indicates a willingness to pay to let others take
	over the individual’s sorting of household waste corresponding to a
	cost of about USD 87 per tonne, which is significant compared to
	the total treatment costs.

Abstract: A discrete choice model for labor supply and child care for

	quality attributes, such as mode of care. Similarly, jobs are
	characterized by a (fixed) wage rate, working hours and a number of
	variables related to job satisfaction. In the estimation of the
	model we take into account that the number of options available
	might vary across work/care combinations, and that some mothers are
	rationed in the market for care at day care centers. The model is
	employed to simulate the female labor supply effects of the

Abstract: Cost-effective environmental policy generally requires that all
	emission sources are faced with the same tax. In this paper I
	discuss how the existence of induced technological change may alter
	this result, if at least some of the effect is external to the
	firm. Focusing on learning by doing effects in abatement
	activities, it is shown that emission sources with external
	learning effects should be faced with a higher tax than emission
	sources with only autonomous technological change. By using simple
	numerical simulations, it is further investigated to what degree a
	cost-effective climate policy differs from a free quota market,
	under various assumptions about learning effects, diffusion of
	technology and environmental targets. The results indicate that
	optimal taxes may be significantly higher in the industrial world
	than in the developing world. Moreover, the industrial world's
	share of global abatement may be much higher in a cost-effective
	solution than in a free quota market. The global cost savings of a

Abstract: Nielsen and Sørensen (1997) find that progressive taxation of
	labour income is optimal when capital income is taxed. This paper
	shows that their main result still holds when introducing
	endogenous choice of occupation, individuals with non- pecuniary
	preferences for one type of occupation, and tuition fees into the
	model, provided the subsidy rate for tuition in the high skill
	occupation is not too low. However, a new result in this paper
	state that efficiency can be reached when labour income tax is
	proportional and capital income is taxed, provided that the rates
	of subsidies for tuition are lower than the labour income tax rate.

Abstract: This paper analyzes tobacco demand within a discrete choice
	framework. Using binomial and multinomial logit models with random
	effects, and an unbalanced panel data set of Norwegian households
	over a twenty year period, we first consider the decisions a)
	whether to smoke or not, and b) given the choice is to smoke,
	whether to smoke hand rolled or manufactured cigarettes. Next, we
	consider a multinomial logit framework, in which the households
	choose between no tobacco, only manufactured cigarettes, only hand
	rolled cigarettes, and a combination of manufactured and hand
	rolled cigarettes. In this process, we utilize the potential
	offered by panel data to investigate unobserved heterogeneity,
	which is crucial for commodities where consumers have different
	tastes and where users tend to become addicted. Using Maximum
	Likelihood in combination with bootstrap estimation of standard
	errors, we find that income and prices influence the 'type of
	tobacco choice probabilities' at least as strongly as the
	'smoking/non-smoking probabilities'. Cet.par., an increase in the
	price of manufactured cigarettes could lead consumers to switch to
	hand rolled cigarettes, rather than quit smoking. Socio-demographic
	variables seem to be at least as important in explaining the
	discrete aspects of tobacco consumption as income and prices.
	Finally, we find significant unobserved household specific effects
	in the smoking pattern.

Classification-JEL:  
Abstract: Weighting adjustment is a standard quasi-randomization approach
	for survey data subject to nonresponse (Little, 1986). The existing
	methods are typically based on the assumption that nonresponse is
	independent of the survey variable conditional to the auxiliary
	variables used to form the adjustment cells. In this paper we
	consider nonignorable nonresponse which is independent of certain
	auxiliary information conditional to the variable of interest. We
	estimate the size of the sample adjustment cells using a method of
	moment conditional to the sample. The method relies on only the
	nonresponse mechanism, and is independent of the sample design. In
	variance estimation, we evaluate the nonresponse effect on
	estimation and design, analogously to the concept of design effect.
	By comparing the nonresponse effects under a nonignorable model
	against those under an ignorable one, we obtain a means of
	measuring the effect of nonignorability. We motivate and illustrate
	our approach for estimation of household composition.

Abstract: Several economists have maintained that social and internalized

	norms for cooperation among strangers in a public good game. The
	experiment has two treatment effects. First, it reveals each
	person's identity and his contribution to the public good. Second,
	it presents the public good game in a language which suggests
	associations to social and internalized norms for cooperation. Both
	treatment effects increase voluntary contributions significantly.
	These results suggest two important policy tools to crowd in social
	and internalized norms in a public good situation.

Abstract: Structural models of lifetime labour supply and consumption

	Misspecifications of the model might lead to biases in the

	predicted distributions of lifetime consumption are robust with
	respect to the specification of preferences. The simulation results
	show that simulated distributions of lifetime consumption strongly
	depend on the estimate of the intertemporal substitution rate as
	well as on the estimate of the time preference rate relative to the
	marginal interest rate net of taxes.

Classification-JEL: D19; D63; H21; H24; H31
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to introduce and adopt a generalised
	version of Roemer's (1998) Equality of Opportunity (EOp) framework
	for analysing optimal income taxation. EOp optimal tax rules seek
	to equalise income differentials arising from factors beyond the
	control of the individual. Unlike the pure EOp criterion of Roemer
	(1998) the generalised EOp criterion allows for alternative
	weighting profiles in the treatment of income differentials between
	and within types when types are defined by circumstances that are
	beyond people's control. An empirical microeconometric model of
	labour supply in Italy is used to simulate and identify optimal tax
	rules within classes of two- and three-parameter tax rules. A
	rather striking result of the analysis is that the optimal tax rule
	turns out to be the pure lump-sum tax, under Roemer's pure EOp
	criterion as well as under the generalised EOp criterion with
	moderate degrees of aversion to within-type inequality. A high
	degree of within-type inequality aversion instead produces
	EOp-optimal rules with positive marginal tax rates. On the other
	hand, when using the conventional equality of outcome (EO)
	criterion, the pure lump-sum tax always turns out to be optimal, at
	least with respect to the classes of two- and three-parameter
	rules. Thus, the results do not conform to the perhaps common
	expectation that the EO criterion is more supportive of
	“interventionist” (redistributive) policies than an EOp approach.

Classification-JEL: D58; H21
Abstract: Efficient capital taxation has been one of the most important
	objectives for large tax reforms implemented in several countries
	during the last decades. The Norwegian Tax reform of 1992 took a
	large step towards tax neutrality between the different capital
	types and uses. However, housing capital is still an exception. The
	marginal effective tax rate on housing is substantially lower than
	the marginal effective tax rates on other capital types and uses.
	In this paper the welfare effects of imposing a neutral system of
	housing taxation are analyzed by using an intertemporal
	disaggregated numerical model for the Norwegian economy. The tax
	reform implies a substantial increase in the tax revenue from
	housing taxation, and the welfare effects of different rebating
	alternatives for the additional tax revenue as lump sum rebating or
	reductions in other distortionary taxes, are considered.

Abstract: In 1967, John Krutilla suggested a relationship between car
	camping, canoe cruising, and cross-country skiing and induced
	demand for wild, primitive, and wilderness-related opportunities.
	Here, the time trend of cross-section parameter estimates of the
	relationship is examined. Households produce nature experiences
	using two factors: nature attributes and tools. Tools are equipment
	and lodging. While many studies have investigated to-site costs of
	producing nature experiences, on-site costs such as equipment and
	lodging are studied here by using Consumer Expenditure Survey data
	for Norway. Income coefficients of household demand for nature
	services in independent cross-section samples for each year are
	estimated over the period 1986-95. Proportions of households with
	non-zero purchase expenditures for equipment are followed from 1975
	to 1995. Similar proportions of lodging expenditures are studied
	from 1986 to 1995. Out of a total of 526 goods in an exhaustive
	system, 20 goods are singled out and classified as nature
	experience tools. Two additional non-good expenses are added.
	Coefficients of demand are estimated for each year by using a tobit
	structure and a maximum likelihood procedure. While income
	coefficients of equipment and lodging are quite stable, household
	size coefficients are not. Both equipment and lodging remain luxury
	items over the period 1986-1995. Proportions of households with
	positive purchase expenditure on tools increase over time: In a
	referendum-by-wallets, nature experience production has received
	more votes and become more popular.

Keywords: Learned helplessness; discouraged workers; multiple unemployment

Classification-JEL: J64; E24
Abstract: Unemployment varies strongly between countries with comparable
	economic structure. Some economists have tried to explain these
	differences with institutional differences in the labour market.
	Instead, this paper focuses on a model with multiple equilibria so
	that the same socioeconomic structure can give rise to different
	levels of unemployment. Unemployed workers' search efficiency are
	modelled within an equilibrium search model and lay behind these
	results. In the model learned helplessness causes a pro-cyclical
	behavior of the aggregate search efficiency, also known as the
	discouraged worker effect. The model can distinguish between
	locally stable and unstable labour market equilibria. The analysis
	shows that if a shock in an antecedent variable brings unemployment
	above the unstable equilibrium, the economy will eventually
	stabilize in a state with an even higher level of unemployment.
	However, a shock that brings the variable back at its initial level
	will not be enough to bring unemployment back at the lower
	equilibrium. Hence, the model also offers an explanation of why
	unemployment seems to move more easily up than down.

Classification-JEL: J31
Abstract: This paper investigates whether economic returns to education in

	may arise from selection effects - the large increase in
	educational attainment in postwar years may have changed selection
	into education. They may also result from changes in the school
	system, having been transformed towards a more egalitarian system.
	Finally, cohort effects may arise from skills obsolescence -
	technological change may make old education less worth in the labor
	market. The empirical results suggest that there has been a decline
	in the returns to education across cohorts. Controlling for
	self-selection into education, however, the cohort differences
	vanish. There is no strong evidence in favor of the skills
	obsolescence explanation, and no support for the hypothesis that
	the quality of schooling has declined over time. Cohort differences
	in returns to education seem to have been driven by selection
	effects.

	to a modest increase in aggregate welfare, as polluting consumption
	rise significantly along with reduced labour effort. Further, the
	trade reforms, in combination with existing policy concessions,
	result in a long-run structural change in favour of heavy-polluting
	export industries. As these are large consumers of electricity,
	prices of clean hydropower rise and cause an economy-wide

Abstract: A common approach to defining equivalence scales is to consider a
	household modelled as if it maximizes a single utility function.
	This may be founded on an assumption of the household maximizing a
	welfare function of individual utilities. For a positive analysis
	of the household, this may be appropriate, but it is argued that
	basing inter-household comparisons of welfare on this approach is
	generally not valid. The household will generally put different
	weight on the utility of the various household members, and this
	weighting does not necessarily correspond to society's aggregation
	of utility. This complication is called the Pangloss problem. An
	alternative definition of equivalence scales taking this into
	account is introduced and discussed.

Abstract: The econometric literature offers various modeling approaches for

	allows unobserved heterogeneity across observation unit, as well as
	unobserved time-specific variables. The time-latent component is
	assumed to consist of a persistent and a transient term. By using a
	Helmert-type orthogonal transformation of the variables it is
	demonstrated that the likelihood function can be expressed on a
	state space form. The dimension of the state vector is low and
	independent of the time and cross section dimensions. This fact
	makes it convenient to employ an ECM algorithm for estimating the
	parameters of the model. An empirical application provides new
	insight into the problem of making forecasts for aggregate
	variables based on information from micro data.

Abstract: The paper presents a panel data analysis of tobacco demand. The
	purpose is threefold: (i) to measure income, own-price, and
	cross-price responses for two tobacco commodities: cigarettes and
	handrolling tobacco, (ii) to investigate sociodemographic effects,
	and (iii) to utilize the potential offered by panel data to
	investigate unobserved heterogeneity. The latter is crucial for
	commodities where consumers have different tastes and where users
	tend to become addicted. Several linear and non-linear
	specifications of a two-equation system are estimated, using an
	unbalanced panel data set of Norwegian households over the period
	1975 - 1994 and a modified Maximum Likelihood procedure.
	Differences between the results based on the sub-sample of smokers
	and on the pooled sample of smokers and non-smokers are
	interpreted. For both commodities we find a high degree of
	unobserved heterogeneity and several robust and “heory consistent”
	patterns with respect to price responses and demographic effects.

Abstract: In most OECD-countries, labour demand has shifted from unskilled
	to skilled over time. Many analyses of this phenomenon focus on
	either the effect of technical change, capital-skill
	complementarity or labour-labour substitution. We present a more
	general analysis of labour demand in Norwegian manufacturing, and
	estimate a multivariate error-correction model of the cost-shares
	of skilled and unskilled labour, materials and energy on
	industry-level panel data. The results show that skilled-biased
	technical change, primarily due to a positive effect on skilled
	labour and less due to a negative effect on unskilled labour, as
	well as labour-labour substitution and capital stock growth are
	important for explaining the shift in Norwegian labour demand. Of
	minor importance is also non-homotheticity.

Abstract: This paper analyses the importance of scale economies by means of
	unbalanced plant-level panel data from three Norwegian
	manufacturing industries. Focus is on heterogeneous technologies,
	and unlike most previous work on micro data, the model description
	includes heterogeneity in both the scale properties (the slope
	coefficients) and the intercept term, represented by random
	coefficients in the production function. Three (nested) functional
	forms are investigated: the Translog, an extended Cobb-Douglas, and
	the strict Cobb-Douglas. Although constant or weakly increasing
	returns to scale is found for the average plant, the results reveal
	considerable variation across plants. Variations in both input and
	scale elasticities are to a larger extent due to randomness of the
	production function parameters than to systematic differences in
	the input mix.

Abstract: We develop an econometric model for firm exit, using stochastic
	dynamic programming (SDP) as a starting point. According to SDP,
	the value of an operating firm can be written as the sum of (i) the
	net present value of continuing production if the firm is committed
	to a future exit date, and (ii) the value of the exit option. By
	approximating the option value by a simple function of its
	determinants, we derive an expression for the distribution of firm
	exit probabilities. The model is estimated by pseudo likelihood
	methods using panel data from the Norwegian Manufacturing
	Statistics. The applicability of the model is illustrated by
	assessing to what extent quotas on emissions of carbondioxide
	increase exits in manufacturing sectors.

Abstract: In this paper, we present an economic model of moral motivation.
	Consumers prefer regarding themselves as socially responsible
	individuals. Voluntary contributions to public goods are motivated
	by this preference. The self-image as socially responsible is
	determined by a comparison of one's actual behavior against an
	endogenous moral ideal. Public policy influences voluntary
	contributions through its effects on relative prices and budget or
	time constraints, but also indirectly through the policy's effect
	on the moral ideal. This implies that economic incentives may have
	adverse effects on contributions. We present survey data on
	recycling behavior and voluntary community work, which is
	consistent with the model predictions.

Classification-JEL: C12; C32; E21.
Abstract: We consider testing for long-run homogeneity within a dynamic
	consumer demand system allowing for non-stationarities. The static
	long-run solution is assumed to follow the Linear Almost Ideal
	Demand System and we test for long-run homogeneity within this
	system utilizing a triangular representation. Both long-run
	homogeneity in single equations and in the entire consumer system
	are considered. Consistent with the general triangular
	representation the deduced share equations depend on both current,
	lagged and leaded differenced explanatory variables (besides level
	variables and deterministic variables capturing trend and
	seasonality). Before testing for long-run homogeneity we test
	whether prices and real total expenditure are Granger-caused by the
	share variables. In the case with Granger-causality the leaded
	differenced variables can be omitted from the equation to be
	estimated. Thus Granger non-causality can be tested by looking at
	the joint significance of all leaded variables in all share
	equations simultaneously. The methodological framework is applied
	on non-durable consumption data from 1966:1 to 1997:4 taken from
	the unadjusted Norwegian National Accounts. We find that the null
	of no Granger-causality are clearly rejected and in light of this
	the differenced variables are retained when testing for long-run
	homogeneity. When testing for long-run homogeneity we consider
	different specifications of the deterministic trend and of the
	lags/leads specification. We find that the homogeneity-tests are
	substantially influenced by the specification of the deterministic
	trend. In one of the specifications long-run homogeneity is neither
	rejected for the single equations nor for the entire system. By
	imposing long-run homogeneity long-run Engel- and price elasticties
	can be calculated. Generally, the long-run elasticities seem
	reasonable.

Classification-JEL: : H42; H72; I18
Abstract: When private goods are publicly provided at subsidized prices,
	government authorities have to determine the distribution of
	services on recipients. Such distributions are commonly based on
	legal regulations and professional guidelines. Thus governments are
	assumed to develop service standards that are incorporated in the
	preferences for allocation of services. The purpose of this paper
	is to analyse the behavior of local governments when they are
	allocating home-care services on elderly and disabled clients.
	Based on Norwegian data it is demonstrated that service standards
	as well as economic constraints have an impact on the supply of
	home-care. As expected the supply to individual clients increases
	with the degree of disablement. The model estimates also show that
	service standards vary substantially between different client
	groups. For instance, service levels for mentally retarded are
	rather high compared to elderly clients in non-single households.
	Individual service standards are derived from observed behavior by
	means of model simulation, where the standards are defined for an
	average level of municipal incomes and prices. The results are used
	to evaluate the degree of mismatch between service supply and
	common service standards in different local communities.

Abstract: A framework based on product differentiation and limited output

	When output capacity is available, the price is set by the supply
	side and export is then given from the demand side. In periods with
	full capacity utilisation, export is constrained from the supply
	side and we are not able to identify the demand curve. Using data
	on capacity utilisation, supply and demand variables in an
	export-equation are weighted in accordance to the development in
	economic cycles. We estimate long-run solutions including foreign
	demand, relative prices and capital stock.

Classification-JEL: E1; F1; Q4; H3
Abstract: Norway has abundant gas resources in the North Sea. The Norwegian
	gas production accounts for 2 percent of the world production and
	17 percent of the European gas production. Despite huge gas
	production and resources, gas is not used for electricity
	generation in Norway. Excess capacity, cheap hydropower, low
	electricity prices and political restrictions have prevented gas
	based power generation in Norway. Lately, import of electric power
	from neighboring countries with fossil fuel based power systems has
	led industry spokesmen and various politicians to propose building
	of several gas power plants in Norway. Electric self-sufficiency,
	domestic natural gas utilization and environmental benefits through
	reduced coal power generation abroad are used as arguments to
	support construction of gas power plants in Norway. Several
	industrial groups have applied for concession to build natural gas
	fired power stations. Initially, the Norwegian Pollution Control
	Authority (SFT) denied emissions concession referring to Norwegian
	obligations under the Kyoto protocol. In March 2000, however, a
	majority in parliament voted against the SFT-decision and advised
	the Government to issue concession. The core argument from both
	sides was the environmental impacts from gas power generation in
	Norway. SFT argued that increased power generation would lead to
	lower energy prices and thereby higher energy consumption and more
	pollution. The view of the majority of Parliament was that
	Norwegian gas power will replace coal power generation in Denmark
	and Germany and thus give lower total climate gas emissions since
	coal based power results in much higher emissions per unit of
	energy than gas power does. The Nordic electricity system and
	market is very complex and therefore energy policy measures may
	result in numerous different impacts and repercussions. Therefore,
	we carry out a number of model simulations to analyze the impacts
	from introduction of Norwegian gas power generation into this
	market. We apply an equilibrium model for the Nordic electricity
	market. In order to describe important intra-year supply-side
	technology and fuel substitution, the Normod-T model has a detailed
	time-resolution. Our calculations show that none of the two views
	are completely right. The aggregate effect on climate emissions
	from producing gas power in Norway may be positive or negative, and
	depends heavily on the assumptions made. Keywords: Electricity

Keywords: Over-shrinkage; synthetic estimator; variance-component model
Classification-JEL:  
Abstract: Over-shrinkage is a common problem in small area (or domain)
	estimation. It happens when the estimated small-area parameters
	have less between-area variation than their true values. To deal
	with this problem, Louis (1984), Ghosh (1992) and Spjøtvoll and
	Thomsen (1987) have proposed various constrained empirical and
	hierarchical Bayes methods. In this paper we study two non-Bayesian
	methods based on, respectively, the synthetic estimator and a
	variance-component model. We show first that the synthetic
	estimator entails loss of dispersion in general, from which it
	follows that the coverage level of the confidence intervals could
	be far below the nominal level of confidence, when these are
	derived from the sampling error alone. A bivariate
	variance-component model at the area-level, as well as its
	simplification, can greatly improve the efficiency of the
	confidence intervals. However, super-population approaches as such
	are unable to capture the distribution of the true area-parameters.
	We develop a finite-population approach based on an empirical
	finite-population distribution function of the area-parameters,
	which provides the necessary adjustment. The various methods will
	be illustrated using the data of the Census 1990. Finally, we
	notice that several European countries will base the upcoming
	Census on their administrative register systems, instead of
	collecting the information in the field. Improved small area
	estimation methods may prove to be valuable for assessing the
	quality of such Register Counting.

Classification-JEL: D31; G35; H25
Abstract: This paper discusses the degree of intertemporal comparability of
	national estimates of income inequality when data are based on
	income tax records. The problem of comparability is particular
	crucial when major tax reforms have taken place and pre- and
	post-reform income data are used as basis for comparing trends in
	income inequality. Particular attention is paid to the definition
	and measurement of income from shares. The conventional wisdom that
	the increase in inequality in Norway during the 1990’s was caused
	by a rising disequalizing contribution of capital income is
	questioned by the present results. The rise in income inequality
	coincided with the implementation of a major tax reform that
	affected the financing incentives in the corporate sector and the
	income shifting incentives in small enterprises. Thus, when tax
	reported dividends are used as a measurement of returns from
	shares, changes in the estimated income inequality may be a result
	of changes in the income reporting behavior rather than factual
	changes in the distribution of income. Our results suggest that the
	observed rise in income inequality during the 1990's to some extent
	can be explained by a change in the dividend policy of the
	corporations, induced by the tax reform in 1992. When the total
	return from shares is taken into account, we find less increase in
	the level of inequality and less increase in the contribution to
	inequality from share ownership.

Abstract: The formation of export prices is an area in which the linear

	Conversely, we show in light of Hendry (1988) that there exists a
	data-coherent conditional equilibrium correction (EqCM) model,
	which is not subject to the Lucas critique. Our findings do not
	support the claim that Norwegian exporters act on expectations

Abstract: This paper explains why people might cooperate playing an
	infinitely recurring prisoners' dilemma in which they change their
	partner in every period. After two people have played the
	prisoners' dilemma there is a possibility for networking. Then, two
	cooperators who played against each other exchange information
	about cooperators that they have met in previous periods. In the
	next period, they use this information in order to increase their
	probability of matching with a cooperator. Whether it is payoff
	maximizing to cooperate, given that all cooperators network,
	depends on the share of cooperators in the society. People learn
	their optimal strategy in a learning process which is represented
	by a payoff monotonic dynamic. The evolutionary analysis shows that
	there exist two stable states: One state in which a large share of
	the people in the society cooperate, and another state in which
	nobody cooperates.

Keywords: Human capital; National Accounts; national wealth; resource rent

Abstract: National wealth can be divided into real capital, financial
	capital, human capital and natural resource wealth. We use the
	National Accounts measures to illustrate the development of the
	wealth from 1930 to 1995, with special focus on the contribution
	from the natural resources. Norway is often described as an economy
	that is very dependent on its natural resources. However, apart
	from the petroleum sector, the resource rent for the natural
	resource sectors was generally small or negative over this period.
	This may indicate that these industries to a large degree fulfilled
	political goals as stimulating employment possibilities in sparsely
	populated areas. The contribution from the traditional natural
	resources to the national wealth declined somewhat over the period.
	Norway seems to have been just as dependent on these traditional
	natural resources in the 1930s as we were on the natural resource
	industries in the nineties, when we in addition extracted oil and
	gas. This may be somewhat surprising, as a common apprehension is
	that Norway becoming an oil producer to a large extent increased
	the importance of the natural resources in the economy. The most
	important economic resource throughout the period was a highly
	qualified labour force, varying from 60 to 80 percent of the total
	national wealth in most years. In years with strong technological
	progress human capital reached over 80 percent of the total wealth,
	as development in know-how and technology ascribes to this category
	of wealth.

Keywords: Passive smoking; regulation; social norms; evolutionary game

Classification-JEL: C72; D11; I18.
Abstract: This paper studies the formation of social norms for considerate
	smoking behavior. Being considerate gives smokers a higher social
	approval from non-smokers, but imposes an inconvenience cost. A
	non-smoker's disapproval of inconsiderate smoking is assumed to be
	stronger the less used he is to being exposed to passive smoking.
	The analysis shows that introduction of a smoking regulation may
	move the society from an initial no-consideration Nash equilibrium
	to a Nash equilibrium in which every smoker is considerate, even in
	the unregulated zone. This crowding in of considerate behavior will
	prevail even after policy reversal. Empirical evidence confirms
	that a shift in social norms on considerate smoking has taken place
	in Norway after the smoking law amendments in 1988, and supports
	the plausibility of model assumptions.

	potentially improved environment, the relationship is highly
	sensitive to the assumptions about accumulation of social capital.

Classification-JEL: D31
Abstract: This paper discusses the effects of the substantial rise in labor
	force participation of married women on the level, structure and
	trend in family labor income inequality. An interesting question is
	to what extent the rise in women's labor force participation has
	led to a tendency of "flocking together", i.e. whether women with
	high labor income are married to men with high labor income, or
	vice versa. Based on the decomposition of the Gini coefficient and
	a related index for the extent of "flocking together" applied to
	income data for Norway for the period 1973-1997 we find a tendency
	of "flocking together" for couples with at least one labor income
	and couples with two labor incomes. For couples with only one labor
	income (i.e. couples where only one labor income is above the
	threshold given by the statistical definition of labor income) the
	decomposition of the Gini coefficient indicates that there is no
	tendency of "flocking together". For this group women's labor
	income gives an equalizing contribution to family labor income
	inequality. This illustrates the importance of distinguishing
	between one- and two-income families in analysis of family labor
	income inequality.

Classification-JEL: Q13; Q25
Abstract: The environmental Kuznets curve theory suggests that economic
	growth may reduce environmental problems. In this article, we
	analyze the changes in environmentally damaging emissions to air in
	Norway from 1980 to 1996. In order to reveal the factors which
	decrease the emissions per produced unit, these changes are
	subdivided into 8 components. Our analysis shows that, holding
	emissions per produced unit constant, economic growth alone
	contributed to an increase in all emissions by about 60 percent. In
	contrast, decreased energy intensity, the substitution of cleaner
	for polluting energy types and other technological progressions
	have reduced the growth. Consequently, the growth in all emissions
	has been significantly lower than economic growth, and negative for
	some pollutants. The emissions of sulfur dioxide and lead had the
	largest reductions over the period. The main cause was
	technological changes, which have generated lead substitutes in
	gasoline and abatement technologies for sulfur. For most other
	emissions, the effect of technological changes was not sufficient
	to weigh up for economic growth. Then the emissions of carbon
	dioxide and nitrogen oxides grew over the period, but far less than
	the growth in GDP. The emission reducing factors may be explained
	by the general technological progress that follows economic growth.
	The correlation between economic growth and the emission reducing
	energy intensity component is for instance significant.

Abstract: We apply two non-ignorable non-response models to the data of the

	where we assume the probability of non-response to be generalized
	proportional to the size of the object variable. We draw the
	inference of the parameter of interest based on the first-order
	theory of the profile likelihood. We adapt the Markov chain
	sampling techniques to efficiently generate the profile likelihood
	inference. We explain and demonstrate why the resampling approach
	is more flexible for the likelihood inference than under the

Classification-JEL:  
Abstract: In case of a single survey at one time point, it is well known
	that combining administrative registers with survey data often
	substantially improves the quality of statistic production.
	However, in short term statistics it is as important to measure
	changes over time as it is to measure the overall level. Using data
	from the Norwegian Labour Force Surveys and administrative
	registers, we demonstrate in this paper that the use of registers
	have little or no effect on the accuracy of estimates of change,
	both in terms of the sampling variance and the bias introduced by
	nonresponse. The survey data alone measures the changes over time.
	One consequence of interest for the rotation design is that a very
	high proportion of the sample can be retained from one survey to
	the next without seriously reducing the accuracy of the level
	estimates. We believe that these findings are relevant to short
	term statistics in general.

Abstract: This project employs the theory of equality of opportunity,
	described in Roemer’s book (Equality of Opportunity, Harvard
	University Press, 1998), to compute the extent to which
	tax-and-transfer regimes in ten countries equalize opportunities
	among citizens for income acquisition. Roughly speaking, equality
	of opportunity for incomes has been achieved in a country when it
	is the case that the distributions of post-fisc income are the same
	for different types of citizen, where a citizen's type is defined
	by the socio-economic status of his parents. Intuitively, a country
	will have equalized opportunity if the chances of earning high (or
	low) income are equal for citizens from all family backgrounds. Of
	course, pre-fisc income distributions, by type, will not be
	identical, as long as the educational system does not entirely make
	up for the disadvantage that children, who come from poor families
	face, but the tax-and-transfer system can play a role in rectifying
	that inequality. We include, in our computation, two numbers that
	summarize the extent to which each country’s current fiscal regime
	achieves equalization of opportunities for income, and the
	deadweight loss that would be incurred by moving to the regime that
	does.

Classification-JEL: D31; D63
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the problem of ranking Lorenz curves
	in situations where the Lorenz curves intersect and no unambiguous
	ranking can be attained without introducing weaker ranking criteria
	than first-degree Lorenz dominance. To deal with such situations
	two alternative sequences of nested dominance criteria between
	Lorenz curves are introduced. At the limit the systems of dominance
	criteria appear to depend solely on the income share of either the
	worst-off or the best-off income recipient. This result suggests
	two alternative strategies for increasing the number of Lorenz
	curves that can be strictly ordered; one that focuses on changes
	that take place in the lower part of the income distribution and
	the other that focuses on changes that concern the upper part of
	the income distribution. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the
	sequences of dominance criteria characterize two separate systems
	of nested subfamilies of inequality measures and thus provide a
	method for identifying the least restrictive social preferences
	required to reach an unambiguous ranking of Lorenz curves.

Abstract: Pervasive skill-biased technological changes, probably from trade
	in computer technology, have visualized the pros and cons of wage
	setting centralization in small open economies. Skill mismatch has
	increased in countries with wage rigidity. As a small open economy
	with centralized wage setting, Norway is a particularly interesting
	case. Indeed, this analysis shows that skill\mismatch has increased
	and is long-lived because of low focus on skill-specific imbalances
	in wage settlements. The conclusions are drawn on the basis of an
	econometric analysis of the determinants of wages to workers in
	five educational categories in Norwegian manufacturing.
	Furthermore, I estimate a 15 per cent drop in equilibrium wages to
	workers with higher university education after 1987, a period of
	recentralization of collective bargaining.

Abstract: A recent study of the welfare state in Sweden, Rosen (1995, 1996,

	deadweight losses that may impede economic growth and the future of
	the welfare state. In this article we show that the deadweight
	losses are highly sensitive to some parameter restrictions implied
	by Rosen's theoretical model. We then critically review the
	relation between the parameter values in Rosen's model. Moreover,
	as a first approach to extend Rosen's model, we analyze the case of
	positive externalities associated with child quality. The positive
	externality provides a rationale for child care subsidies, as
	expected, and also influences the optimal income tax rate.

Abstract: We evaluate consequences of some important assumptions ofthe

	geometric depreciation. The data are plant-level panel data from
	the Norwegian manufacturing statistics, containing independent
	measures of capital stocks and gross investment flows for two
	capital types and three industries. First, we look at consequences
	of choosing different depreciation rates a priori, when we use as
	benchmark for the level of the capital stocks deflated fire
	insurance values in a specific year. The choice of depreciation
	rate is of substantial importance, some values resulting in
	decreasing, other in increasing capital stocks over time. Second,
	we attempt to estimate depreciation rates by combining time series
	on gross investment and fire insurance values for the same period.
	In our regression models, both systematic and random measurement
	errors in the fire insurance values and various forms of
	heterogeneity in the coefficient structure are represented. We
	conclude that the estimated depreciation rates vary significantly
	with the specification of the measurement error process and that
	heterogeneity in this process across plants is important.

Classification-JEL: D24; L11
Abstract: It is an established fact that firms, even within narrowly
	defined industries, differ with respect to productivity. In this
	paper we analyse how observed heterogeneity in productivity is
	affected by endogenous producer behaviour, and to what extent
	shifts in firm specific productivity parameters will affect
	aggregate industry productivity. We find that endogenous producer
	behaviour and equilibrium adjustments may strongly affect observed
	productivity of firms and aggregate industry productivity. This
	makes it problematic to interpret them as structural parameters.
	The main lesson from the paper is that identification of such
	parameters should rely on structural models, in which the
	equilibrium determinants of observable productivity for individual
	firms, the distribution of output shares over firms, and the number
	of firms are taken into account. One may otherwise draw very
	misleading conclusions about changes in structural parameters from
	observed productivity variations, either between firms or for an
	industry over time.

Keywords: Selection bias; discrete/continuous choice.
Classification-JEL: C13; C35
Abstract: In this paper we discuss two types of selection problems. The
	first problem is motivated by labor market analyses such as the
	estimation of sector-specific wage equations where the sector for
	which the wages are observed are chosen by the agents. In contrast
	to previous formulations which usually are based on a probit
	framework, we assume here that the discrete choice is generated by
	a multinomial logit model with random coefficients (mixed
	multinomial logit model). The advantage compared to the multinomial
	probit setting is that choice sets with many alternatives become
	almost as easy to handle as the binary case. The second problem we
	analyze is motivated by studies where the interest is to estimate
	the effect of for example labor market training programs on the
	labor market opportunities. Previous works have, to the best of my
	knowledge, focused solely on the effect of labor market programs on
	earnings. As in the first case we allow for arbitrarily large
	choice sets of feasible first stage choices (programs) as well as
	the second stage choices (labor market status).

Abstract: Improving the distributional impact of transfers may be costly if

	non-behavioural simulations on micro data. The direct
	distributional effects are assessed by tax&#61485;benefit model
	calculations. Female labour supply responses to alternative child
	benefit schemes are simulated under the assumption that choices are
	discrete. The discrete choice model is justified with reference to
	the complicated process of finding a new job, and the existence of
	peaks in the empirical distribution of hours is interpreted as
	variation in number of jobs across states. The distribution of
	income after labour supply responses is also shown. The analysis
	confirms that enhanced distributional impact is traded against
	reductions in labour supply.

Abstract: Recently, it has been demonstrated that pre-existing
	distortionary taxes can substantially increase the costs of
	market-based instruments which do not raise revenue, such as
	non-auctioned emissions quotas. Revenue-raising market-based policy
	tools, such as carbon taxes, encounter other problems: The
	redistribution of property rights implied by introduction of such
	instruments is politically controversial, and in practice, tax
	rates are often differentiated to reduce political resistance. In
	the latter case, marginal abatement costs are not equalized between
	polluters. When comparing a policy with differentiated carbon taxes
	to a policy of free-issued quotas, financed through distortionary
	taxes, it is thus not obvious which alternative yields the highest
	social welfare. In this paper, we use a numerical intertemporal
	general equilibrium model for the Norwegian economy to compare the
	welfare effects of a differentiated carbon tax regime, exemplified
	by the current Norwegian carbon tax structure; a system of
	grandfathered tradable emission permits; and a uniform carbon tax
	regime. Grandfathered tradable quotas yield substantially lower
	welfare than the other two alternatives. However, differentiated
	taxes produce almost as high welfare as uniform taxes.

Abstract: Several studies, conducted on U.S. data, have found rather strong
	income responses to changes in marginal tax rates, when treating
	tax reforms as "natural experiments" and applying the
	differences-of-differences estimator on individual income data. The
	Norwegian tax reform of 1992 implied substantial increases in the
	net-of-tax rate (1 minus the change in the marginal tax rate) for
	high-income earners, and this paper provides measures of the
	elasticity of taxable income with respect to these tax rate
	changes. The natural experiment assumption of the
	differences-of-differences approach is discussed. Since the tax
	reform implied other tax changes and both demographic variables and
	shifting macroeconomic conditions might impact on income growth, we
	include other explanatory variables in addition to the net-of-tax
	rate changes. When including other explanatory variables, tax
	elasticity estimates are affected, but only modestly. Our estimates
	of the elasticity of taxable income due to changes in the marginal
	net-of-tax rate range from about -0.20 to about 0.14.

Abstract: This paper analyses the markets for fossil fuels given that the

	countries extend beyond 2008-2012. To our knowledge we are the
	first to apply a forward-looking model with endogenous prices for
	fossil fuels in analysis of specific CO2 emission targets, under
	different assumptions concerning OPEC behaviour. We calculate both
	the time-path of the international permit prices needed for the
	Kyoto targets as well as the implications through reduced demand
	and lower producer prices for fossil fuels. Irrespective of the
	assumption concerning OPEC behaviour, the permit price has to rise
	for the first 30 to 40 years in order to fulfil the Kyoto targets

Abstract: This paper uses neoclassical theory as a foundation for modelling
	labour demand in Norwegian manufacturing. Applying the Johansen
	(1988,1991) methodology, we obtain a single cointegrating vector
	between employment, production, relative factor prices, total
	factor productivity and the stock of real capital. Normalised on
	employment, the estimated long run elasticities are 1.37
	(production), &#61485;0.32 (relative factor prices), &#61485;0.57
	(total factor productivity) and &#61485;1.00 (the stock of real
	capital). Next, we develop a conditional labour demand model that
	exhibits parameter constancy. In addition to equilibrium correction
	effects, we find contemporaneous effects of production and relative
	factor prices. We cannot reject super exogeneity to be present in
	our labour demand equation. Hence, the evidence on labour demand in
	Norwegian manufacturing does not lend support to the Lucas
	critique.

Abstract: Empirical estimates of long run effects on residential
	electricity demand from changes in the electricity price are
	usually estimated by cross-sectional variation in the current stock
	of electric household appliances across households at a certain
	point in time. Here, we use a discrete-continuous approach modeling
	the long run effects by investments in new appliances. We apply the
	annual Norwegian Survey of Consumer Expenditure for the period 1975
	to 1994 to estimate the short and long run own price elasticities
	in the two approaches. We find the estimated long run elasticity
	only slightly more price elastic than the short run. We also find
	that the long run elasticity does not differ significantly between
	the two approaches. The reason for both results is that, since
	there is no alternative source of energy for these appliances,
	there are no substitution effects.

Keywords: Local public finance; expenditure need; fiscal disparities;

Classification-JEL: H71; H72
Abstract: Fiscal disparities arise from differences in costs and capacity
	to produce a standard package of public services. This paper
	proposes to use a structural modelling approach as basis for
	measuring fiscal disparities across municipalities. This approach
	differs from the widely used reduced-form approach, in the sense
	that identification of minimum required costs or expenditure need
	is made by reference to a structural model of the fiscal and
	spending behavior of local governments. The empirical analysis,
	which is based on data for Norwegian municipalities, relies on
	various alternative measures of fiscal capacity. One of these
	measures is defined by the local tax-bases, whilst another also
	includes grants-in-aid from the central government. This
	facilitates identification of the equalizing effect from grants. By
	comparing the effects of the current grant system with the effects
	of a policy designed to reduce fiscal disparities it is
	demonstrated that the goal of locational neutrality is far from
	being fulfilled. Moreover, it is shown that differences in local
	priorities only give a minor contribution to the observed
	differences in service levels.

Abstract: Norwegian female labour participation rates have increased
	steadily since the beginning of the seventies. This paper address
	several issues concerning female labour participation series for
	the period 1972-1997. The main purpose is to identify factors that
	explain the trend-like increase during the last 25 years and a
	possible cyclical component that is due to labour market
	conditions. The resulting relations for women in the age-groups
	25-39 years and 40-59 years include long-run effects from wages,
	education and a significant cyclical component. The wage elasticity
	is the same for the two groups by restriction. For the older women
	(60-66 years) we find a higher wage elasticity. Children have a
	negative impact on the labour supply for female 25-39 years. We get
	no significant effects from the extension of the parental leave and
	day-care coverage.

Keywords: Trade Reforms; Intertemporal CGE Model; Welfare
Classification-JEL: F12; F13; D58; D61
Abstract: A disaggregated intertemporal CGE model is used to simulate the
	welfare effects in Norway of the recently implemented trade reforms
	including the WTO agreement, the EEA treaty, the EFTA fishery
	agreement and an anticipated EEA resolution on shipbuilding. These
	reforms affect the Norwegian economy through changes in tariffs,
	Non Tariff Barriers (NTBs), government procurement and subsidy
	policy as well as shifts in world prices and demand. Reduction of
	such import barriers that represent real costs for the country is
	identified as the most important source of welfare gains, through
	improved terms of trade. Due to initial distortions caused by taxes
	and imperfect competition, changes in the resource allocation have
	first order effects on welfare. In particular, this explains why
	the simulated reduction of employment has a significant negative
	impact on the total welfare gain.

Abstract: This paper presents an analysis on economy-environmental
	interlinkages for Tanzania by using a computable general
	equilibrium (CGE) model based on a social accounting matrix. The
	purpose of the analysis is to include general equilibrium effects
	when evaluating two suggested policy measures meant to stimulate
	growth and crop production. The model is multisectoral with a
	particular focus on crop producing sectors and soil mining
	processes. Maize trade liberalization and a fertilizer subsidy are
	considered. The model simulations show that both policy reforms
	have expansive effects and that there are significant sectoral
	complementarities between agriculture and non-agriculture in
	Tanzania. Fertilizer subsidies promotes cash crop production and a
	more land intensive production pattern in agriculture, while a
	maize trade liberalization stimulates food crops and a more land
	extensive agriculture. Fertilizer subsidies are found to imply far
	more expansive effects than a trade liberalization does. Only minor
	differences are identified between the two policy reforms as
	concerning their impact on the balance of trade, distribution and
	the environment.

Abstract: In this paper we focus on how an international climate treaty
	will influence the exploration of oil in Non-OPEC countries. We
	present a numerical intertemporal global equilibrium model for the
	fossil fuel markets. The international oil market is modelled with
	a cartel (OPEC) and a competitive fringe on the supply side,
	following a Nash-Cournot approach. An initial resource base for oil
	is given in the Non-OPEC region. However, the resource base changes
	over time due to depletion, exploration and discovery. When
	studying the effects of different climate treaties on oil
	exploration, two contrasting incentives apply. If an international
	carbon tax is introduced, the producer price of oil will drop
	compared to the reference case. This gives an incentive to reduce
	oil production and exploration. However, the oil price may increase
	less rapidly over time, which gives an incentive to expedite
	production, and exploration. In fact, in the case of a rising
	carbon tax we find the last incentive to be the strongest, which
	means that an international climate treaty may increase oil
	exploration in Non-OPEC countries for the coming decades.

	be justified by postulating a utilitarian social welfare function,

	concept, there is no generally accepted way to verify the
	plausibility of this latter assumption, nor its empirical
	importance. In this paper we use data from seven contingent

	marginal utility of the public good for all individuals, aggregate

Keywords: Growth; Status preferences; relative consumption; relative

Classification-JEL: 040
Abstract: This paper examines the implications of status-seeking behavior
	for long-term growth in a competitive economy. We explore the
	intuitive hypothesis that the quest for enhanced economic status
	leads to excessive levels of production and consumption. In a
	Ramsey growth model in which preferences are altered to include a
	concern for relative consumption, status seeking has no impacts on
	the economys long-run equilibrium in the absence of a labor-leisure
	tradeoff. Relative consumption effects do, however, induce
	short-term departures from efficient resource allocation, either
	augmenting or depressing consumption growth rates in accordance
	with the elasticity of substitution between consumption and status.
	In the case where social status is defined in terms of the relative
	accumulation of manufactured capital, status seeking leads to
	excessive rates of short-run growth and inefficiently high levels
	of capital and consumption in the long-run equilibrium. Similar
	results hold when preferences embody a concern for career status as
	captured by the relative accumulation of human capital, and when
	relative consumption effects are accompanied by a labor-leisure
	tradeoff.

	consumption grows, the marginal benefits of consumption decrease
	more than the marginal benefits of status. In equilibrium, however,
	there will be price effects that may more than outweigh this
	effect. Thus, there is no a priori reason to expect more
	status-seeking behavior in richer societies.

	subsequently test the hypothesis that, apart from a random “noise”
	component, the age-specific parameters change over time according
	to a common trend. We find that the hypothesis is not rejected by

Abstract: This paper analyses the generation of waste in production
	processes, based on the physical law of conservation of mass. By
	this law, mass going into a production process must equal the mass
	coming out of the same process. The paper uses this mass balance
	perspective to refine a previously developed technique for
	forecasting waste amounts. A macro economic model predicts the use
	of intermediate inputs and production in monetary units, and by
	multiplying these variables with weight conversion factors we
	estimate physical amounts going in and out of production. The
	difference between input and output, the residual, consists of
	discharges to land, water and air. We predict a growth in the
	residuals for manufacturing industries of 83 per cent from 1993 to
	2010. The growth is partly explained by an anticipated growth in
	material intensity.

Abstract: A framework for analyzing substitution and scale properties, and
	technical change from plant-level panel data is presented. Focus is
	on comparing the constant and random coefficient specification of
	the substitution and scale parameters and investigating the
	potential variation of the parameters across firms. Characteristics
	of the model framework are (i) an equation system consisting of a
	three-factor translog cost function and the corresponding
	cost-share equations, (ii) random firm specific heterogeneity in
	coefficients, and (iii) a Maximum Likelihood procedure allowing for
	unbalanced panel data. The empirical results, based on data from
	Norwegian chemical plants, indicate substantial firm specific
	heterogeneity in substitution and scale properties.

Abstract: This paper discusses the properties of price- and Cost-of-Living
	indexes that follow from specific assumptions about the structure
	of consumer preferences. Of particular interest are indexes for
	elementary aggregates. In the first part of the paper we show how
	particular indexes for elementary aggregates emerge from a micro
	model with heterogeneous consumers and unobservable choice sets of
	product variants. Subsequently, we demonstrate that these indexes
	also follow from a particular preference structure of a
	representative consumer. Indexes that are currently used in many
	countries emerge as special cases of the ones proposed in this
	paper.

Classification-JEL: D23; Q25
Abstract: Negotiating an international tradable quota treaty between
	industrialised and developing countries is complicated by uncertain
	marginal abatement costs and non-uniform quota prices. An initial
	quota allocation that implies zero expected net cost to developing
	countries will typically be insufficient to attract their
	participation in the treaty. Two options to compensate for
	uncertainty are discussed here, extra emissions quotas and
	financial transfers. The latter is found to be more effective in
	facilitating treaty-making, but the scope of co-operation is
	restricted by the developing countries’ risk-aversion.

Abstract: The main aim of this paper is to test the stability of the
	results of a model which focus on the relationship between the
	choice of heating equipment and the residential energy consumption.
	The results for the income and energy price variables are of
	special interest. Stability in the time dimension is tested by
	applying the model on micro data for each of the years 1993, 1994
	and 1995. The parameter estimates are stable within a 95 per cent
	confidence interval. However, the estimated impact of the energy
	price variable on energy consumption is considerably weaker in 1994
	than in 1993 and 1995. The results for two different income groups
	in the pooled data set are also subject to stability testing. The
	energy price sensitivity in residential energy consumption is found
	to be higher for high-income households than for low-income
	households.

Abstract: In this paper the demand for space heating energy is estimated by
	using a discrete-continuous choice model which focuses on the
	relationship between the choice of heating equipment and energy
	consumption. The model is estimated on Norwegian micro data, and
	the two stages of the model are estimated simultaneously. The
	capital cost and the operating cost of the heating systems are both
	found to have a significant impact on the choice of heating system.
	Furthermore, the results show that household characteristics are
	important variables in residential energy models. Energy price
	elasticities and income elasticities are estimated.

Classification-JEL: C31; C43; D12
Abstract: This paper discusses a particular approach to empirical consumer
	demand modelling when products are differentiated and the product
	attributes are unobservable. In contrast to the traditional
	approach to this problem, see e.g. Epple (1987) and Deaton (1987,
	1988), where the product variants are treated as infinitely
	divisible goods, the present approach assumes that the consumer is
	making his choice of variant from a set of discrete "packages" of
	attribute combinations. Subsequently, given the (discrete) choice
	of variants the corresponding quantities are treated as continuous
	choices. Thus in this approach the consumer's decision process is
	formulated as a discrete/continuous choice problem. The empirical
	analysis is based on microdata from the Sichuan province in China.
	We show that in this case the estimation methods work well and
	yield reasonable results.

Classification-JEL: D11; D60; Q00
Abstract: Economic models typically assume that individual wants are
	determined by forces exogenous to the economic system. Social
	psychology and consumer research, in contrast, support the view
	that the perceived benefits of consumption are strongly affected by
	endogenously determined social norms. This paper presents a
	selective overview of the literature on the relationship between
	consumption and well-being, exploring the ways in which informal
	arguments from the descriptive social sciences might be linked to
	formal models of economic behavior. We incorporate Sen’s (1985)
	distinction between commodities and functionings into Nordhaus’
	(1994) model of climate change and the world economy, showing that
	optimal paths for greenhouse gas emissions and capital accumulation
	are highly sensitive to the role of consumption norms in the
	welfare determination.

Abstract: This paper uses imperfect competition as a basis for modelling
	the export price for an aggregated commodity produced by the
	Norwegian private mainland economy. The long run solution is
	analysed using a cointegration technique. The dynamics are modelled
	according to two different approaches; a backward looking error
	correction model and a forward looking model where rational
	expectations are assumed. The dynamic structure of the forward
	looking model is derived from a linear quadratic adjustment cost
	function under rational expectations, but the empirical results do
	not support this specification. We cannot reject super-exogeneity
	to be present in the backward looking error correction model. The
	empirical evidence are thus not consistent with rational
	expectations.

Keywords: Structural reform; Efficiency gains; General equilibrium effects
Classification-JEL: C68; C81; H50; L70; L98
Abstract: This paper discusses and shows how a CGE model can be used to
	assess welfare effects of structural policy reforms targeting
	inefficiency problems at micro levels that normally are not
	captured in operational CGE-models. The CGE approach allows
	computation of shadow prices which are generally both unobservable
	due to various price distortions, and endogenous. Moreover, the
	paper discusses how static measures of sectoral inefficiency can be
	implemented in a CGE-model that accounts for real world dynamics.
	Results from CGE-simulations suggest that general equilibrium
	effects have substantial influence on welfare, at least when the
	initial waste of resources is as large as reported in sector
	studies for Norway. More precisely, compared to the CGE-estimate a
	partial equilibrium approach overestimates the welfare gain by more
	than 30 percent.

	replacing the standard price indexes by a indexes which are derived
	from underlying behavioral assumptions. The empirical application
	is based on a sample of Norwegian micro data market prices and

Abstract: Economists, in particular Bresnahan and Trajtenberg (1995), have
	recently drawn attention to the importance of generic or general
	purpose technologies (GPTs) and their significance for economic
	growth. An interesting part of this research identifies
	coordination problems in the introduction of GPTs, and the
	potentially large benefits in coordinating research and product
	development. Thinking about information technology as a GPT, with
	the associated coordination problems, seems to fit well with the
	motivation behind governmental support schemes to IT and related
	high-tech industries in Norway. The first part of our study focoses
	on a series of such IT-programs that have been implemented in
	Norway from the early 1980s, with the objective of coordinating the
	development of information technology and its application
	throughout the economy. We examine in some detail the largest of
	these IT-programs through its planning and implementation stages
	and emphasize how closely it is connected to recent economic
	analysis of GPTs. The second part of our study examines to what
	extent these governmental plans and subsidy schemes have been
	successful in creating economic results in terms of growth and
	profits in the IT and IT-related industries. In the final part of
	the paper we discuss some of the lessons about the problems with
	technology policy at a practical level.

Abstract: This paper presents evidence on household savings in urban
	regions of the Chinese provinces Sichuan and Liaoning based on data
	from the State Statistical Bureau's Urban Household Survey for the
	late 1980s. In this period the Chinese economy was subject to
	extensive reforms that resulted in rapid economic growth followed
	by extremely high inflation rates in 1988 and 1989. The high
	inflation rates gave the households strong motives to switch from
	financial savings to purchase of consumer durables, which also
	appear to be consistent with the structure of the observed data. By
	providing empirical evidence on the relative importance of savings
	by lower, middle and upper income groups for single-child families
	and for all households, this study also demonstrates that the
	savings decisions depend heavily on the level of household income.
	Single-child families are focused, not only because of its growing
	dominance in the current Chinese society, but also to control for
	the effect of demographic disparities.

Classification-JEL: C32; E32; E63; F41
Abstract: This paper analyses the role of real and nominal shocks in
	explaining business cycles in a small open economy like that of
	Norway. In particular, we study the sources behind real exchange
	rate fluctuations since the collapse of the Bretton Woods
	agreement. Imposing long run restrictions implied by economic
	theory on a structural vector autoregression (VAR) model containing
	GDP, unemployment (or price), real wage and the real exchange rate,
	four structural shocks are identified; Velocity (or monetary),
	fiscal, productivity and labour supply shocks. The model is also
	augmented to allow for oil price shocks.The identified shocks and
	their impulse responses are consistent with an open economy
	(Keynesian) model of economic fluctuations, and highlights the
	exchange rate as a transmission mechanism in a small open and
	energy based economy. Especially, I have found a plausible sequence
	of shocks (productivity shocks in the 1970s, velocity shocks in the
	mid-1980s, productivity and labour supply shocks in the late 1980s,
	and velocity and fiscal shocks in the early 1990s), which help to
	explain the evolution of GDP, unemployment, price, real wage and
	the real exchange rate. The results are robust to alternative
	specifications of the model and are stable over the sample.

Abstract: In the US tradable SO2 permit scheme 97.2 per cent of the permits
	are grandfathered annually to electricity utilities. The remaining
	2.8 per cent are withheld and offered for sale at the Environmental
	Protection Agency (EPA) auction. Also, the electricity utilities
	may tender permits for sale both at this auction as well as on a
	complementary permit market. Cason and Plott [3] recommend that the
	EPA seriously consider reforming the present auction procedure for
	SO2 permit trading. They provide experimental evidence of downward
	biased auction prices that understate the marginal cost of
	emissions control. Our comparison with available empirical data
	shows that the complementary market for SO2 permits disciplines the
	auction inasmuch as the auction and market prices are not
	significantly dissimilar. This fact and the extent of conducted
	permit trade render improbable the assertion that the EPA auction
	price differs from the true marginal abatement cost. Hence, the
	policy relevance of the EPA auction's alleged faults may be
	negligible.

Abstract: Applications of the standard theory of UMP unbiased tests depends
	on conditions which in general are difficult to verify. In the
	present paper, however, we suggest more simple rules for applying
	this theory for regular exponential families of distributions. This
	approach leads to UMP unbiased tests for various multiparameter
	testing problems with restricted alternatives, and is shown to give
	justification for conditional tests of various test problems for
	contingency tables. The derived tests are shown to possess
	attractive small sample properties.

Title: Why some Corporations Pay More Tax than Necessary

Keywords: Corporate taxes; Depreciation; Reporting conventions
Classification-JEL: D21; H25
Abstract: It has been noticed in several countries that many corporations
	do not claim all of their allowable tax depreciation deductions,
	despite incurring a higher tax cost. There are several possible
	explanations. First, the uniform reporting accounting system
	(typical of many European countries) can under certain
	circumstances constrain dividends. The dividend constraint can,
	however, be loosened by forgoing some tax depreciation. We find no
	support for this hypothesis. Second, we find strong evidence that
	corporations with bad economic performance tend to underutilize
	their deductions, suggesting that corporations use costly
	“window-dressing” on their accounting measures. Third, we find
	support for the hypothesis that tax compliance costs discourage the
	utilization of accelerated depreciation, especially by small firms.
	Fourth, we find weak support for the hypothesis that there is
	substitution between tax depreciation and private debt due to
	competition between the benefits of private bank monitoring and the
	tax savings from using tax debt, as suggested in earlier
	literature. Our empirical analysis is possible due to unusual
	access to extremely detailed individual firm tax returns forms in
	Norway, combined with the 1992 Norwegian tax reform that provided a
	natural experiment for testing some of the hypotheses. We use the
	time-series and cross-sectional variation across Norwegian
	corporations in 1988, 1991, 1992 and 1993.

Classification-JEL: Q43; E37; E61
Abstract: Macroeconomic effects of the high oil prices in the period
	1979-85 for the Norwegian economy are considered. An alternative
	low oil price scenario is developed and effects of the oil shock
	are calculated as the deviation between actual history and the
	counterfactual base. International effects based on a world model
	are fed into a domestic model to analyse consequences for the
	Norwegian economy. Without imposing any changes in fiscal policies,
	negative effects from lower foreign demand and higher interest
	rates are dominating. However, as a major oil exporting country, we
	argue that the high oil prices spurred a substantial increase in
	Norwegian public spending. Effects of a more expansionary fiscal
	policy, based on a relatively conservative spending strategy, are
	shown to more than outweigh the negative initial impact on GDP.
	Possible outcomes for the business cycle development are also
	studied

Keywords: Climate catastrophes; CO2 emissions; optimal policy
Classification-JEL: D6; Q2
Abstract: This paper concerns optimal emissions of greenhouse gases when
	catastrophic consequences are possible. A numerical model is
	presented which takes into account both continuous climate-feedback
	damages as well as the possibility of a catastrophic outcome. The
	uncertainty in the model concerns whether or not a future
	catastrophe will occur. However, the welfare losses imposed by such
	an outcome are assumed known to the decision-maker. An important
	result is that the possibility of a climate catastrophe is a major
	argument for greenhouse gas abatement even in absence of continuous
	damage. Special attention is given to analyses on the probability
	of a catastrophe and the pure rate of time preferences, and the
	implicit values of these parameters are calculated if the Rio
	stabilisation target is assumed to be optimal. Finally, the
	expected value of perfect information about the probability of the
	arrival of a catastrophe is estimated.

Abstract: Do wage differences between workers with high and low levels of

	We address this set of questions on the basis of a data set with
	variables for individual workers matched with a comprehensive data
	set for manufacturing plants in Norway for the period 1986-93. The
	results suggest that workers with higher education tend to be more
	productive, roughly in accordance to their wage premium. Female
	workers are cet. par. found to be less productive than male
	workers, and this is reflected in their wages. Experienced workers
	are on average found to be more productive. For workers with 8 to
	15 years of experience, the productivity premium exceeds the wage
	premium, while the opposite is the case for workers with more than
	15 years of experience.

Keywords: Tax reform; Income distribution; Social welfare; Personal tax
Classification-JEL: D31; D63; H2; H31
Abstract: Are we better or worse off after the Norwegian tax reform of 1992
	and how has the reform influenced the income sizes and the
	distribution of total income? This question denotes our twofold
	analysis in this paper. We first examine the trends in average
	income and income distribution in the period from 1991 to 1994.
	Second, we ask whether the tax reform can explain parts the
	observed income changes. Calculations from a tax-benefit model,
	assessing the direct distributional effect by applying post-reform
	tax rules on pre-reform data, do not predict any substantial
	increase in income inequality due to the tax reform of 1992.
	However, we find a significant post-reform increase in observed
	income inequality, while average income is about unaltered in the
	period. The increased inequality might be explained by the high
	income earners’ response to large reductions in marginal tax rates.
	By applying panel data for 1991-1994 and a methodological approach
	developed by Feldstein (1995a), we find no evidence in support of
	significant behavioral responses due to decreased marginal tax
	rates on income. In fact, the overall elasticities are around zero,
	which differ substantially from Feldstein’s estimate of 1.04, based
	on US-data. Other explanations, as the changes in the taxation of
	dividends, are discussed.

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of estimating the number of

	model for household size given registered family size while taking
	into account possible nonresponse biases by modeling the response
	mechanism conditional on household size. Various models are
	considered together with regression estimation and imputation-based
	poststratification. Comparisons are made with the estimation
	methods used in official statistics for The Norwegian Consumer
	Expenditure Survey. We conclude that poststratification, response
	modeling and imputation should be used instead of the current
	method in official statistics, a modified Horvitz-Thompson method.

Classification-JEL: A13; D61; D70; H43
Abstract: In traditional cost-benefit analyses of public projects, every
	citizen’s willingness to pay for a project is given an equal
	weight. This is sometimes taken to imply that cost-benefit analysis
	is a democratic method for making public decisions, as opposed to,
	for example, political processes involving log-rolling and lobbying
	from interest groups. Politicians are frequently criticized for not
	putting enough emphasis on the cost-benefit analyses when making
	decisions. In this paper we discuss the extent to which using
	cost-benefit analysis to rank public projects is consistent with
	Dahl’s (1989) criteria for democratic decision-making. We find
	several fundamental conflicts, both when cost-benefit analysis is
	used to provide final answers about projects’ social desirability,
	and when used only as informational input to a political process.
	Our conclusions are illustrated using data from interviews with
	Norwegian politicians.

Author-Name: Jørgen Aasness and Liv Belsby
Author-Workplace-Name: Statistics Norway

Keywords: National accounts; latent variables; stochastic trends; state
	space models.
Classification-JEL: C82.
Abstract: We present an approach for estimating time series of a set of
	latent variables satisfying accounting identities. We concentrate
	on a simple case study and comment on possible generalizations. The
	model consists of three main parts: (i) A system of accounting
	identities, e.g., a subsystem of the national accounts, which
	variables are considered latent. (ii) A measurement model
	connecting the latent variables to indicators from different
	sources, including micro and macro data. (iii) Stochastic processes
	of a subset of the latent variables in the accounting system, with
	stochastic trend and random walk as alternative models. The model
	is given a state space formulation and the Kalman filter and EM
	algorithms implemented in the software STAMP, are used to estimate
	the parameters and the time series of the latent variables. The
	approach is applied to estimate petrol consumption of the household
	and nonhousehold sectors in Norway 1973-1995, from observation of
	macro data on total petrol consumption and survey data of household
	expenditures for petrol. Satisfactory model properties are
	obtained. The stochastic trend model gives smooth and plausible
	estimates of the time series of latent petrol consumption of the
	household and nonhousehold sectors.

Abstract: We analyse how inequality of disposable income evolved in

	1990s when unemployment rose dramatically in all four countries. We
	find that a standard measure of inequality - the Gini coefficient -
	was surprisingly stable in all countries over this period. By
	decomposing the Gini coefficient into a number of income
	components, we can test hypotheses about the reasons for the stable
	income distribution. Our most straightforward hypothesis, that
	rising unemployment benefits have counteracted the impact of more
	unequally distributed earnings, gets only limited support. More
	complex mechanisms seems to have been at work in the Nordic

Abstract: This paper calculates core inflation, by imposing long run

	Core inflation is identified as that component in inflation that
	has no long run effect on output. No restrictions are placed on the
	response of output and inflation to the oil price shocks. The
	analysis is applied to Norway and the United Kingdom, both oil
	producing OECD countries. A model that distinguishes between
	domestic and imported inflation, is also specified for Norway. In
	both countries, core inflation is a prime mover of CPI (RPI)
	inflation. However, CPI (RPI) inflation overvalues or undervalues
	core inflation in many periods, of which oil price shocks are
	important sources behind this deviation for prolonged periods

Abstract: This paper studies the impacts on Western European CO2 emissions
	of a reduction in Norwegian gas sales. The impacts are due to
	changes in energy demand and energy supply, but environmental and
	political regulations also play an important role. The gas supply
	model DYNOPOLY is used to analyse the effects on Russian and
	Algerian gas exports of a reduction in Norwegian gas supply. The
	effects on the demand side and the effects of committing to CO2
	targets are analysed using the energy demand model SEEM. If the
	Western European countries commit to keeping their announced CO2
	emissions targets, regardless of the costs associated with this, a
	reduction in Norwegian gas sales will have no impact on emissions.
	However, the consumption of oil and coal will increase slightly,
	while total energy consumption will go down. A reduction in
	Norwegian gas sales also seems to have only minor impacts on the
	CO2 emissions from Western Europe in the situation where no
	emissions regulations are considered.

Abstract: This paper studies how productivity shifts at the level of the

	between firms. The two kinds of shifts affect aggregate
	productivity in different ways and through different mechanisms.
	Endogenous equilibrium adjustments play a crucial role for the
	influence on aggregate productivity. Moreover, when firms sell
	their output to several markets, and their market power differs
	between markets, aggregate productivity may be inversely related to
	productivity at the firm level. A by-product of the analysis is to
	demonstrate that productivity heterogeneity can be incorporated in
	the standard model of monopolistic competition at a low cost in
	terms of analytical tractability.

Abstract: This paper treats local governments as utility maximizing agents
	when they allocate resources among different service sectors. We
	present estimates for eight service sectors, based on a modified
	version of the extended linear expenditure system (ELES) and using
	observations at the municipal level for Norway. Our econometric
	model recognizes user fees and budget deficits as endogenous
	variables. Moreover, the model accounts for heterogeneity in local
	tastes and production costs. Price information for local public
	services is not available in the data. However, by allowing for
	heterogeneity in the marginal budget share parameters, we achieve
	identification of the complete ELES. The empirical results show
	that local public services are in general price-inelastic. Welfare
	services like education, social services and care for the elderly
	and disabled are income-inelastic, while infrastructure is rather
	income-elastic. A strong flypaper effect is revealed by the
	response of user fees to income changes. Finally, results from
	out-of-sample predictions show that the ELES model is able to
	simulate local government behavior quite well.

Abstract: This study demonstrates the quantitative, as well as the
	qualitative, role of non-tariff barriers (NTBs). The Norwegian
	nominal tariff and non-tariff barriers are identified and
	thoroughly quantified. Computations of effective rates of
	protection (ERP) show that NTBs entirely dominate tariffs as direct
	contributors to primary factor income, which again is an important
	determinant in allocation of resources among industries. The
	indirect input-output effects play a decisive role. This points to
	the importance of estimating the nominal trade barrier inputs
	properly; when a biased estimate is spread throughout the
	input-output system, not even the direction of the miscalculation
	will be easy to predict. In order to demonstrate the qualitative
	role, NTBs are categorised into price-oriented and
	quantity-oriented, respectively. ERP computations illustrate that
	the conclusions of policy analyses rely critically on the
	qualitative interdependency between quantity-oriented NTBs and
	other measures.

	substitution between labor and capital, with an elasticity of
	substitution of about 0.4 at the plant level. This indicates that
	increased taxation of capital will have a positive substitution

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of structural adjustment
	policies on deforestation taking place when the agricultural
	frontier advances into forest reserves in Nicaragua. A computable
	general equilibrium model incorporating deforestation by squatters
	is used for policy simulations. The opportunity cost of migrating
	to the frontier does not simply depend on wage income opportunity,
	but also on market prices of basic grain which determine the
	capacity to consume beyond subsistence food level within a certain
	real wage. Reducing public expenditures both conserve forests and
	enhance economic growth, while showing positive distributional
	effects. On the other hand, a strong conservation trend following a
	sales tax increase is driven by increasing poverty in rural areas.
	Noticeably, there are policies which initially intensify
	deforestation, but turn out to ease the pressure on forests over
	time. Rapid economic growth does not ensure less pressure on forest
	reserves.

Abstract: General Method of Moments (GMM) estimation of a linear

	considered. To eliminate fixed individual heterogeneity, the
	equation is differenced across one or more than one periods and
	estimated by means of instrumental variables. With
	non-autocorrelated measurement error, we show that only the
	one-period and a few two-period differences are essential, i.e.
	relevant for GMM-estimation. GMM estimation based on all
	orthogonality conditions on the basis of a generalized inverse
	formulation is shown to be equivalent to estimation using only the
	essential orthogonality conditions

Abstract: In this paper, a model of the nitrogen cycle in the soil is
	incorporated in a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model of the
	Tanzanian economy, thus establishing a two way link between the
	environment and the economy. For a given level of natural soil
	productivity, profit maximising farmers choose a production
	technique and the optimal production volume, which in turn
	influences the soil productivity the following years through the
	recycling of nitrogen from the residues of roots and stover and the
	degree of erosion. The model is used to simulate the effects of
	typical structural adjustment policies: a reduction in
	agro-chemicals subsidies, reduced implicit export tax rate, a
	devaluation of the currency, a cut in governmental expenditure and
	a reduction of foreign transfers. The result of a joint
	implementation is a 9 percent higher GDP level compared to the
	baseline scenario after 10 years. The effect of soil degradation is
	found to represent a reduction in the GDP level of more than 5
	percent for the same time period.

Keywords: Firm growth; R&D-investment; Gibrat’s law; Product innovations
Classification-JEL: L11; O32; D92
Abstract: We present a model of endogenous firm growth with R&D investment
	and innovation as the engine of growth. The objective of our
	analysis is to present a framework that can be used for
	microeconometric analysis of firm performance in high-tech
	industries. The model for firm growth is a partial equilibrium
	model drawing on the quality ladder models in the macro growth
	literature, but also on the literature on patent races and the
	discrete choice models of product differentiation. We examine to
	what extent the assumptions and the empirical content of our model
	are consistent with the findings that have emerged from empirical
	studies of growth, productivity, R&D and patenting at the firm
	level. The analysis shows that the model fits well empirical
	patterns such as (i) a skewed size distribution of firms with
	persistent differences in firm sizes, (ii) firm growth (roughly)
	independent of firm size (the so-called Gibrat’s law) and (iii) R&D
	investment proportional to sales, as well as a number of other
	empirical patterns.

Abstract: In the Norwegian fabricated metal industry there has been a shift

	increased. The paper analyses the factors behind the shift in the
	composition of these three kinds of labour. A translog cost
	function approach is applied, using an error-correction
	representation of the development in cost shares. The results
	indicate substitutability between unskilled and both skilled and
	white collar workers. Increased supplies of skilled workers and
	engineers seem to have been the most important factors for the
	change in the composition of employment, indicating lack of persons
	with these kinds of education. In addition, unskilled workers have
	been rationalized away as a result of technical progress.

Abstract: This paper studies soil depletion incentives in a dynamic
	economic model under two different sources of revenue uncertainty
	(production- and output price risk). The focus is on the long-term
	effects of risk averse preferences. The land manager is assumed to
	posses three classes of instruments to control natural topsoil
	fertility over time. Each instrument is also assumed to have
	implications for expected short-run production. The analysis shows
	that the forces at play are different across the three agricultural
	activities considered and varies for the two sources of risk
	analysed. In order to predict how risk aversion may influence soil
	conservation incentives detailed information is needed about input
	use and cultivation practices and the farmers' perception of their
	risk implications. If higher output is associated with higher
	levels of soil degradation, risk averse preferences will strengthen
	the incentives for soil conservation under output price
	uncertainty, and the same outcome is likely under production
	uncertainty. If higher levels of outputs is associated with lower
	levels of soil degradation, risk averse preferences will induce a
	farmer to conserve less soil under output price uncertainty, while
	the likely outcome of production uncertainty is the opposite

Abstract: This paper analyses the non-environmental welfare costs of an

	revenue neutral such that an increase in the carbon tax rate is
	accompanied by a reduction in the payroll tax. By exploiting
	existing tax wedges in the labour market and between consumption
	and saving, the total non-environmental welfare effect of the tax
	reform is positive. The paper also analyses how imperfect price
	expectations for the investors in real capital influence the total
	welfare costs of the tax reform. The welfare effect is the same due
	to exploitation of initial distortions, but the transitional
	dynamics are quite different in the two paths.

Abstract: Considering the observed patterns of R&D investment, we argue
	that a model which allows for a positive feedback from already

	the empirical evidence better than the standard model that treats
	knowledge accumulation symmetrically to the accumulation of
	physical capital. We present an econometric framework consistent
	with a positive feedback in the accumulation of R&D capital. The
	empirical model is econometrically simple and less data-demanding
	than the standard framework. Our estimates show a significant
	positive effect of R&D on performance and a positive feedback
	effect from the stock of knowledge capital. We calculate the
	depreciation rate and the rate of return to knowledge capital for
	our alternative framework, and compare our estimated rate of return
	to results obtained within the standard framework.

Abstract: This paper analyses the effects of so-called "green" tax reforms
	on a small, open economy producing an imperfect substitute for
	foreign goods, using an intertemporal general equilibrium model.
	The labour market is characterised by union wage setting, and a
	fixed exchange rate implies wage rigidity and involuntary
	unemployment. The long run effects on instantaneous utility,
	employment and the stock of real and financial capital of a revenue
	neutral increase in the tax on fossil fuels combined with a) lump
	sum rebating or b) change in the labour income tax rate, are
	discussed. Due to the changes in instantaneous utility during the
	time path following the implementation of the tax reform, the total
	welfare effect may be positive even with a reduction in long run
	consumption. The total welfare effect is in general more positive
	(or less negative) with wage tax reduction than lump-sum rebating.

Keywords: Income distribution; Gini coefficient; decomposition; household

Classification-JEL: D31; D13.
Abstract: This paper aims at clarifying the notion "overall distributive
	effect" of an income component or a policy proposal and moreover
	discusses various approaches for assessing the distributional
	impact of the components of total income. We pay particular
	attention to the problem of evaluating the distributional
	consequences of including a new income component in the statistical
	income base. Our example is the value of unpaid household work,
	which statistically is new to the income base, although
	conceptually it is included in extended income or full income, so
	that individual time allocations are already reflected in data. In
	contrast, introducing a genuinely new income component (e.g. a new
	transfer payment) will lead to behavioral responses that should be
	accounted for in the distributional analysis. However, it is
	standard practice to ignore behavioral responses in official
	analyses of tax and benefit reforms (e.g.a new transfer payment)
	and to compare the Gini coefficients with and without the new
	income component given unchanged behavior. Rather than solely
	comparing the levels of the Gini coefficients we suggest that one
	should compare the decompositions of the Gini coefficients with and
	without the new income component. This result gives a clarification
	of the difference between contribution to inequality and (marginal)
	effect on inequality.

Classification-JEL: Q30; Q40.
Abstract: In this paper we ask whether OPEC still gains from cartelisation
	in the oil market despite low producer prices and a modest market
	share. We apply two intertemporal equilibrium models of the global
	oil market; one consisting of a cartel and a fringe, and one
	describing a hypothetical competitive market. Comparing the outcome
	of these models we conclude that there are positive cartelisation
	gains of about 18 per cent in the oil market. In comparison with
	what Pindyck (1978) found for the 1970s this may be considered as
	quite modest. Moreover, we study whether the cartelisation gains to
	OPEC are altered by different moves by non-OPEC producers or
	consumer countries. Generally, we find that the relative
	cartelisation gains are unchanged. One exception is exploration
	activities, where we find that a major increase in non-OPEC
	reserves could remove the cartelisation gains to OPEC completely.
	In this case, the OPEC-countries could find themselves better off
	without the cartel.

	interpretation of reported willingness to pay. I formalize this
	problem using a simple model of respondents' behaviour, based on
	the concept of subjective social welfare functions. The model may
	provide one explanation to several puzzling phenomena often found
	in contingent valuation studies; such as large discrepancies
	between willingness to pay and willingness to accept, frequent
	occurrence of "outliers" willing to pay extremely large amounts,
	and certain kinds of framing effects.

Abstract: This paper analyses the sources of business cycles in economies

	investigate the effects of oil and gas extractions (energy booms)
	on the manufacturing sector, and analyse whether there is any
	evidence of a "Dutch disease", that is whether energy booms have
	had adverse effects on the manufacturing base. In additions to
	energy booms, I identify three other types of disturbances in the
	economy; aggregate demand, supply and oil price shocks. The
	different structural disturbances are identified by imposing
	long-run and short-run (zero) restrictions on a vector
	autoregressive model. The analysis is applied to Norway and United
	Kingdom, which both discovered huge oil resources in the North Sea
	in the 1970s. There is no evidence of a Dutch disease in Norway,
	and manufacturing output has actually benefited from both energy
	discoveries and higher oil prices. In UK on the other hand,
	manufacturing output has declined in response to energy booms,
	although the effect is small compared to the effects of the other
	shocks that are present at the time.

	instruments are calculated. During certain episodes fiscal policy
	appeared procyclical, an effect that is due to the aim of

Abstract: Oil price shocks have played a dominant role in the macroeconomic
	development of the world economy over the last twenty five years.
	In this paper a large, estimated, macro-economic world model with
	time varying trade weights, monetary and fiscal policy rules and
	explicit modelling of the behaviour of the OPEC countries is used
	for counterfactual analyses of oil price shocks. An alternative
	history with constant real oil prices is developed, showing that
	the recessions in the OECD area in 1974/75 and in 1980 would have
	been milder without the preceding oil price hike, while the 1982
	recession seems unrelated to oil prices. A separate simulation
	indicates that the oil price drop in 1985/86 prevented a small
	recession from developing. The paper also shows that macroeconomic
	oil price effects vary considerably between the US, Germany and
	Japan according to the degree of oil dependence, trade with OPEC
	and the working of domestic labour markets. In particular there are
	notable differences in inflationary effects in Germany and the US.
	Results are tested against alternative specifications of monetary
	and fiscal policy rules.

Abstract: In this study we model effects on Norwegian industry and trade

	model to simulate the difference between an economy adapted to the
	mentioned reforms and an economy based on a multilateral
	maintenance of the pre-reform trade system. Exports and import
	shares are modelled differently depending on commodity
	characteristics. Labour supply and national wealth are exogenously
	determined in order to focus on the gains from reallocations of
	given resources. The results indicate strong effects on the
	patterns of industry and trade. Specifically, we observe an
	increase in the production of services and highly processed goods,
	and a decrease in the production of raw materials and less
	processed commodities.

Abstract: Generation of solid waste is closely associated with the use of
	tangible factor inputs and production levels in the economy. In
	this paper, we present projections of waste generated in the
	Norwegian manufacturing industry based on the development in these
	factors as simulated by a computable general equilibrium model.
	Over the simulation period, material input becomes relatively
	cheaper than labour and energy, thereby making it profitable to
	substitute materials for other factor inputs. This substitution
	effect is a general equilibrium effect mainly due to technological
	change. It dominates the direct material saving impact of
	technological progress in most production sectors. Thus, generated
	solid waste rises over the simulation period, both in terms of unit
	produced and per capita. The analysis predicts an increase in
	generated waste over the period from 1993 to 2010 in the range of
	45 - 110 per cent, depending on the type of waste.

Abstract: This paper analyses the dynamic effects of aggregate demand,

	Oil price shocks are included explicitly in the model, to
	investigate their role in explaining periods of global recessions.
	The different structural disturbances are identified by imposing
	long-run and short-run restrictions on a vector autoregressive
	model. The analysis is applied to Germany, Norway, United Kingdom
	and United States. For all countries except Norway, an adverse oil
	price shock has had a negative effect on output in the short run,
	and for US, the effect is negative also in the long run. However,
	whereas the first oil price shock was the most important factor
	behind the severity of the recession in the middle 1970s, adverse
	demand and supply shocks were more important than the second oil
	price shock in explaining the recession in the early 1980s. For
	Norway, a small oil exporting country, an adverse oil price shock
	stimulates the economy, although in the long run, the effect is
	most likely zero.

Title: Dynamic Choice, Multistate Duration Models and Stochastic Structure
Author-Name: John K. Dagsvik

Keywords: Life cycle consistent discrete choice; taste persistence; state
	dependence; Markovian choice processes; extremal processes; random
	utility processes; independence from irrelevant alternatives.
Classification-JEL: C25; C41; D91
Abstract: An important problem in the analysis of intertemporal choice
	processes is how to justify the choice of mathematical structure of
	the transition probabilities. A related and delicate identification
	problem is to separate the effect of unobserved variables from the
	influence on preferences from past choice behavior (state
	dependence). The present paper proposes a particular behavioral
	assumption to characterize the stochastic structure of
	intertemporal discrete choice models under the absence of state
	dependence. This assumption extends Luce axiom; "Independence from
	Irrelevant Alternatives", to the intertemporal context. Under
	specific regularity conditions the implication of these assumptions
	is that the individual choice process is a Markov chain with a
	particularly simple structure of the transition probabilities. By
	drawing on results obtained by Dagsvik (1983, 1988) it is
	demonstrated that this structure is consistent with an
	intertemporal and life cycle consistent random utility model where
	the utilities are independent extremal processes in time. Finally,
	the framework is extended to allow for state dependence and time
	varying choice sets.

	show that there are high efficiency costs for Norway and low costs
	for Italy and Sweden associated with the current progressive labor
	income taxes. However, there appears to be large variation in the
	distribution of welfare gains/losses. "Rich" households – defined

	households from replacing the current progressive tax systems by
	proportional taxation.

Abstract: This paper studies the effects on fossil fuel prices, extraction
	paths and petroleum wealth of an international carbon tax on fossil
	fuel consumption. We present an intertemporal equilibrium model for
	fossil fuels, where the main focus is on the oil market. The
	impacts of a global carbon tax of $10 per barrel of oil depend
	heavily on the market structure in the oil market. If OPEC acts as
	a cartel, they reduce their production to maintain the oil price.
	Thus, the effects on the oil wealth of the competitive fringe is
	minor, while OPEC's oil wealth is considerably reduced. This may
	explain the difference in attitudes of OPEC and other oil producing
	countries to international global warming negotiations. If, on the
	other side, the oil market is competitive, the highest relative
	reductions in the oil wealth are to be found among non-OPEC
	producers.

Abstract: Members of the Norwegian Parliament were interviewed about the

	found cost-benefit analysis useful, but apparently not as a device
	for ranking projects. Rather, the cost-benefit ratio was used to
	pick project proposals requiring political attention among the
	large number of projects included in the plan. However, information
	about project-related local conflicts seemed to be used much more
	extensively for this latter purpose. Attitudes towards cost-benefit
	analysis varied along the left-right political axis. These findings
	are shown to be consistent with a hypothesis that politicians
	rationally maximize subjective perceptions of social welfare.

	respondent's preferences. Several versions of a random utility
	model are formulated and estimated. They include the ordered logit
	model and a model with preferences that are correlated across
	experiments. The model is applied to predict changes in demand
	resulting from price changes, and to assess the willingness to pay

Keywords: Soil mining; soil erosion; intertemporal optimization.
Classification-JEL: Q10; Q24.
Abstract: Many African countries are richly endowed with land, but the
	productive potential of the land base has been underutilised in
	farming systems with low intensity of external inputs and high
	intensity of labour. At the same time, mining and erosion of soils
	have been common features of rural Africa in the 1990s. National
	income, possibly of considerable size, is foregone in countries
	with pervasive poverty. This paper studies the income and wealth
	from the agricultural sector in Tanzania. The gains from a policy
	redesign are examined by formulating an intertemporal optimization
	problem where land degradation processes such as soil mining and
	erosion are taken explicitly into account. We show that land
	degradation processes, if dealt with in the optimal way, would
	deviate from the patterns that are currently observed. Two versions
	of the model are presented. One considering only the nutrient
	stocks as determinant of land producticity. The other version also
	includes the effective rooting depth as determinant of land
	productivity. Using these models, we compute the soil wealth under
	the assumption that the opportunity cost of labour is equal to
	current wages, and under the assumption that opportunity cost of
	labour is zero. In both cases our estimates suggest that the
	potential gains from a change in agricultural management are
	considerable.

Abstract: This paper studies the implications of climatic uncertainty and

	while the second model describes the role of soil conservation
	inputs. Both models are first analysed under farmer risk aversion.
	Then farmers which operate at a minimum level of subsistence are
	considered. It is shown that the consequences for the soil
	conservation decision from both risk aversion and poverty tend to
	be opposite for the two models. Output-induced soil depletion
	increases when agrarian producers are poor and risk averse. The
	incentives for soil conservation improve for the same two reasons
	when soil conservation inputs are analysed.

Abstract: It is often claimed that the opportunities to create new

	concentrated in products which are technologically advanced and
	knowledge intensive. This paper examines the relationship between
	job creation and innovation, as measured by R&D investments, in
	Norwegian manufacturing. We compare job creation in plants
	belonging to R&D firms to plants belonging to firms without R&D. We
	also compare job creation in plants belonging to high and low tech
	industries. Our data set covers more than 80 percent of
	manufacturing employment in Norway over the period 1982-92. The
	paper challenges the optimistic view about job creation in R&D
	intensive firms and high-tech industries. Some main findings are:
	(i) Net job creation is not higher in high-tech industries. (ii)
	There is no clear-cut positive relationship between net job
	creation and the R&D-intensity of the firm. (iii) There is less net
	job creation and less job-security in R&D-intensive firms in the
	late 1980s and early 1990s.

Abstract: This paper is concerned with the distribution of income and the

	the shape of the income distribution. The paper also demonstrates
	that this type of inequality measures have an explicit normative
	foundation as well as an attractive statistical/geometrical
	interpretation. Furthermore, it is shown that the measures'
	sensitivity to transfers depend on the shape of the income

	are highly significant in a structural import price equation, which
	also contains positive effects of growth in domestic demand and

Abstract: The present paper uses the model by Campbell and Mankiw (1991) to

	financial deregulation. This evidence indicates a substantial
	departure from the rational, forward-looking behavior, and there is
	thus reason to believe that liquidity constraints did bind the
	Norwegian consumer behavior until the mid 1980s. Our results
	further suggest that this evidence has disappeared after the
	financial deregulation in that the estimated fraction of current
	income consumers is essentially zero after 1985. This finding is so
	much more remarkable in that hardly any other aggregate time-series

Abstract: This paper will focus on a particular provision in the Norwegian

	user cost model is derived, and this model is used to discuss the
	impact on investment incentives that stems from imputation of
	capital income. Within this framework, we discuss potential
	distortions that stem from certain elements in the Norwegian tax
	code. The formalised approach allows us to focus more on the
	assumptions underlying the analysis, and we show that the user cost
	of capital is dependent of the discount rate. We also use our
	approach to calculate potential tax wedges. The calculations show
	that the distortions can be quite large, under realistic
	assumptions.

Keywords: Infrastructure; public transport investment; economic growth.
Classification-JEL: C32; E62; H54; R42.
Abstract: An issue of major concern to politicians and policy-makers around
	the world today is whether transport infrastructure investments,
	such as those in roads and airports, generate enough economic
	benefits to justify their very large price tag. Beginning in the
	mid 1970s, nearly all OECD countries experienced a sustained
	decline both in public investment and in private sector output.
	Since infrastructure comprises the vast majority of public capital
	in these countries, this led many economists to conclude that
	underinvestment in infrastructure was largely responsible for the
	low growth rates in output and productivity which were experienced
	by these countries. In our paper, we discuss the findings in the
	literature with respect to both econometric and modeling
	deficiencies. Based on these criticisms, we develop a cost function
	modeling approach which includes public transport infrastructure
	capital, perform an econometric analysis and discuss several of our
	estimates of infrastructure productivity effects. The paper
	concludes that, in nearly all production sectors (except
	oil/agriculture), the public transport infrastructure investments
	made in Norway over the last 20 years significantly reduced private
	production costs and altered demand for private inputs. However, we
	find such effects to be statistically insignificant at the
	aggregate level.

Abstract: An extended community preference model including real and
	financial investments is estimated on accounting time-series data
	for the local public sector in Norway. The estimation results
	indicate considerable sluggishness in local public spending, both
	in current expenditure and investment spending. A positive shift in
	grants or taxes will in the short run lead to reductions in the net
	debt, due to the sluggish spending adjustment. But as spending
	adjustments take place, the effect on the net debt is reversed, so
	the long run effect is positive. <p> The long run elasticities of
	factor demand and net debt with respect to exogeneous income
	constraints do not differ significantly from unity. The estimated
	price elasticities suggest that factor demand is close to
	neutral-elastic in the long run. Higher factor prices involve
	higher production costs, and local authorities are thus induced to
	increase user charges.

Abstract: The Norwegian export price for an aggregated commodity is
	modelled assuming price-setting behaviour. The focus is on the
	choice between backward- and forward looking models. The dynamics
	is modelled according to three different approaches; a backward
	looking error correction model and two forward looking models where
	rational expectations are assumed. The first forward looking model
	is derived from a multiperiod quadratic loss function imposing
	backward-forward restrictions on the parameters. The results from
	this specification are not encouraging. We then allow data to
	choose the lead structure, resulting in a less restrictive forward
	looking model. The backward- and forward looking models are
	compared to an estimated cointegrating vector for the long-run
	solution. An encompassing test on the backward- and forward looking
	model indicates that further research should look for a model that
	encompasses both of them.

Classification-JEL: C22; D43; D84;
Abstract: The paper analyses the price on domestic market for an aggregate
	commodity produced by Norwegian private mainland economy. The
	long-run solution is modelled assuming imperfect competition. The
	elasticities with respect to unit labour costs and competing prices
	vary with an indicator for competitive strength in domestic market.
	I consider two models for the dynamic part of the equation. Model A
	is a conditional ECM in current and lagged variables. Model B is
	derived from a multiperiod quadratic loss function which introduces
	rational expectations to the model. The backward-forward
	restrictions are not rejected. The estimated elasticities for both
	models are in line with the previous empirical results for the
	Norwegian economy. Model A is preferred to Model B, partly on the
	basis of informal encompassing results.

Abstract: We employ a large scale macroeconometric model to study
	transitory adjustment problems and long term welfare effects of a
	Norwegian EU-membership. Compared to the present European Economic
	Area (EEA) treaty, accession would primarily require economic
	reforms in the fields of agriculture, public finance and trade.
	When we ignore the yearly net contribution of approximately 1
	billion ECU (1 per cent of GDP), integrating the Norwegian economy
	into EU generates a small welfare gain. The results seem to be
	strongly affected by a long transition period with
	under-utilisation of resources. With the costs of the net
	contribution included, we identify a welfare loss. This is
	especially so if fiscal policy is adjusted to maintain public and
	current account balances. To investigate the stability of the
	results when the estimated wage rate response and trade
	elasticities are altered, we present two sensitivity tests. None of
	them give us reason to cast doubt on the qualitative conclusions
	presented.

Classification-JEL: C4; C5; D1; D3.
Abstract: A complete system of consumer expenditure functions with 28
	commodity groups is modelled and estimated by means of Norwegian
	household panel data. Measurement errors are carefully modelled.
	Total consumption expenditure is modelled as a latent variable,
	purchase expenditures on different goods and two income measures
	are considered as indicators of this basic variable. The
	distribution of individual differences in preferences, represented
	by individual, time invariant latent variables in the expenditure
	functions, is structured by means of a two level utility tree which
	permits a parsimonious parameterization. The usual assumption of no
	measurement error in total expenditure is clearly rejected. The
	standard assumption in factor analysis of uncorrelated measurement
	errors is also clearly rejected. In particular, we find positive
	correlation between measurement errors (purchase residuals) of food
	groups which may be explained by rational shopping behavior of the
	households. The purchase residuals for automobiles show negative
	serial correlation and positive correlation with the volatile
	components of latent total expenditure, which is reasonable for
	such a durable good. The first and second order moments of the
	observed variables, which are the input in the analysis, consist of
	2015 elements which is modelled by means of 213 structural
	parameters in our reference model. The maximum likelihood estimates
	of the latter have, with only a few exceptions, the expected sign
	and a reasonable size.

Abstract: The welfare effects of introducing taxes on emissions of carbon
	dioxide is analysed within an empirical general equilibrium model
	of the Norwegian economy. A CO2 tax regime where we aim at
	stabilising the CO2 emissions at the 1990 emission level in 2020 is
	compared to a reference scenario without such taxes. In the
	simulations introduction of CO2 taxes reduces gross domestic
	product, but increases net national real disposable income, private
	consumption and money metric utility. This difference in sign is
	due to a positive terms of trade effect, some of the CO2 taxes will
	be paid by foreigners through exports. The welfare effects differ
	from household to household depending on the composition of their
	total consumption. Poor households are less favourably affected
	than rich households, due to smaller budget shares for the rich
	households on consumer goods which imply relatively much CO2
	emissions.

Abstract: We measure the effective assistance to 17 Norwegian private
	industries in 1989 and 1991 caused by government budgetary
	subsidies, indirect commodity taxes, import protection through
	nominal tariffs and non-tariff barriers, and electricity market
	distortions. The assistance effects are measured by the change in
	the net-of-tax value added price due to a removal of the policy
	measures considered. Most industries were effectively assisted, but
	the effective assistance differs widely between industries
	indicating the overall distortive effect on the industry structure.
	Agriculture, Food Processing and Manufacture of Beverages and
	Tobacco stand out as the most assisted industries. Budgetary
	subsidies and non-tariff barriers had the strongest effective
	assistance effect.

Classification-JEL: D31; D33; D63; H24
Abstract: This paper focuses on the measurement of progressivity and the
	distributional effect of the Norwegian tax reform of 1992.
	Progressivity is measured by the degree of disproportionality,
	which implies that the burden of taxes is estimated when income
	units are ranked according to pre-tax incomes. The measure of
	disproportionality is decomposed to estimate the influence from
	different parts of the tax system on total disproportionality. For
	instance, the measure of the contribution from net taxes can be
	decomposed into a tax base effect and a tax rate effect. The
	results show that the degree of progressivity in the overall tax
	system, as measured here, has not been altered from 1991 to 1992,
	but the decomposition analysis reveals that the tax base effect is
	more dominant and the tax rate effect is less dominant after the
	reform.

Abstract: This paper analyses the effects of a carbon tax on a small open
	petroleum producing economy, using an aggregate intertemporal
	general equilibrium model with differentiated products. The long
	run effects on welfare and capital accumulation of both a
	unilateral and an international carbon tax are emphasised. It is
	shown that the steady state welfare effect of a carbon tax can be
	positive or negative, depending on substitution effects which
	create efficiency losses, and income effects from changes in terms
	of trade. The presence of an initial tax wedge implies that there
	is an ambiguous relationship between the tax level and steady state
	welfare. With an international carbon tax the terms of trade gain
	is smaller and the petroleum revenue is reduced compared to a
	unilateral carbon tax, implying that for a petroleum producing
	economy an international carbon tax may be less beneficial than a
	unilateral carbon tax.

Keywords: Deregulation; Electricity markets; Natural gas markets; CO2-taxes

Abstract: Electricity markets have typically been regulated all over the
	world. In Europe, UK and Norway have begun to deregulate their
	electricity markets. Several more countries will probably join them
	in the near future, for example Finland, Sweden and Spain. The
	objectives are twofold: to increase efficiency and to contribute
	both locally and globally to environmental improvement. Even larger
	regions like the European Union, plan to deregulate their internal
	electricity markets. For the EU this implies introduction of third
	party access to the transmission grid within and between the Union
	member countries. In this context, the Scandinavian push towards
	deregulation is an interesting experiment. We discuss the
	consequences of an international deregulation of electricity
	markets on the basis from simulations on an empirical energy market
	model for the Nordic countries. Deregulation may have severe
	effects on the location of new power plants within the Nordic area
	and implies a large impact on the income distribution both among
	countries and between electricity producers and consumers. The
	beneficial effects of deregulation are highly dependent upon the
	Nordic natural gas trade and prices. In our model, international
	co-ordination of environmental instruments like carbon dioxide
	taxes has a greater impact on emission level reductions than does
	deregulation. However, deregulation also contributes.

	perform a number of sensitivity analyses. Most of our results are
	remarkably robust to alternative assumptions. Contrary to
	widespread opinion, a low discount rate increases the environmental
	drag on welfare. Reducing the rate of technological progress will

Abstract: This paper analyzes the (re)entry of Norwegian mothers into
	full-time and part-time employment following the first and second
	birth. Based on theories of job search and human capital
	depreciation and appreciation a semi-parametric hazard model is
	estimated, expressing the entry rate as a function of a woman's
	full wage (the market wage plus the present value of reductions in
	future earnings due to a career break) and her reservation wage. As
	predicted, a higher market wage and higher accumulated employment
	experience before birth are found to speed up the return to work,
	but the positive effect of employment experience declines with time
	since birth. The most powerful predictor of after-birth employment
	is the length of prior home-time periods. Having stayed at home a
	long time before birth strongly inhibits the return to both
	full-time and part-time work, and the effect becomes stronger the
	longer the time since birth. This is in line with the notion that
	women tend to be either persistent workers or persistent
	non-workers, as is found in several U.S. studies. New to this study
	is the evidence of persistency also in full-time and part-time
	work, as previous full-timers are much more likely to return to
	full-time and previous part-timers are much more likely to return
	to part-time work. All in all, there is no evidence that part-time
	workers have a looser attachment to the labour market than
	full-time workers.

Abstract: This paper discusses the problem of specifying probabilistic
	models for choices (strategies) with uncertain outcomes. The most
	general case we consider is choice settings where the uncertain
	outcomes are sets which may contain more than one alternative. This
	is of interest for the following type of choice processes that take
	place in two stages: In stage one the agent has the choice between
	uncertain sets of alternatives and only knows the probabilities of
	which alternative that belongs to each set. Conditional on the
	choice in the first stage the content of the chosen set is revealed
	and the agent chooses (under perfect certainty) the most preferred
	one from this set. The standard setting in which the outcomes are
	single alternatives, follows as a special case of the model. <p>
	The point of departure is a generalization of Luce IIA assumption
	to choice experiments with uncertain outcomes and we analyze the
	implications when IIA is combined with particular assumptions about
	invariance with respect to aggregations of strategies.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for estimating non-Walrasian
	models with many markets based on the virtual price approach in Lee
	(1986). The paper discusses an open economy multi-market
	non-Walrasian model with many agents and government production. The
	modeling of the labor markets is built on the assumption that each
	combination of worker and firm is a separate micro labor market.
	The econometric specification in the paper assumes log-linear
	virtual prices. Despite the use of such a simple specification it
	is apparent that when there are a large number of markets, the
	computational burden of estimation becomes heavy due to the large
	number of possible rationing regimes. The model presented in the
	paper can be viewed as a basis for either doing econometric work
	within a multi-market representative agent framework or for
	developing methods for aggregating across micro markets.

Abstract: Cost-benefit analysis have been attacked by many critics because

	rational, benevolent politicians will only in special cases accept
	the evaluation of projects resulting from a cost-benefit analysis.
	An alternative approach to project evaluation, which allows
	individual decision makers to rank projects in accordance with
	their own ethical views, is presented. In this framework, estimates
	of willingness to pay are generally not required. On the other
	hand, information about groups that are significantly affected by
	the project, as well as physical unit information on changes in the
	supply of public goods, is crucial.

Abstract: The labour market in Norway, as in other Scandinavian countries,
	is often claimed to be overregulated and incapable of adjustment to
	changes in job opportunities. The results presented in this paper
	suggest to the contrary that in terms of job creation and job
	reallocation between plants, the manufacturing sector in Norway is
	surprisingly flexible, and similar to the manufacturing sector in
	other OECD countries such as the U.S. We show that 8.4 percent of
	the manufacturing jobs are eliminated annually, while new jobs
	constitute 7.1 percent of manufacturing employment, in an average
	year. Even in a serious recession year, a considerable number of
	new jobs are created. The paper also examines job creation in small
	versus large plants (and firms), as well as young versus old
	plants. The results provide support to selection models a la
	Jovanovic (1982), while vintage-capital models seem to be largely
	irrelevant as models of plant heterogeneity.

Abstract: A methodology to describe the distributional and behavioural
	effects of child care subsidies is presented within a micro
	simulation framework. We discuss the effects of changing the
	governmental policy to support families with preschool children,
	from today's subsidisation of spaces at child care centres to an
	equal cash transfer to all families with preschoolers. In the
	decision model applied (Michalopoulos et al. 1992) the mother
	chooses consumption, market time and average quality of child care.
	The model is adjusted to the Norwegian child care market and data
	for mothers who both are employed and receiving child care
	subsidies (1990) are used, since this group of mothers is assumed
	to respond most to the reform. Weaknesses in data and simplifying
	model assumptions imply that the results must be used with caution.
	Results from our simulation experiment do not indicate any large
	decrease in mothers labour supply, when altering the transfer
	system. The reform will give a substantial decrease in inequality
	among households with preschoolers, since the child care subsidies
	very much favour well-off households.

Abstract: In this paper we provide a formal analysis to evaluate the

	candidates for being subtracted from GDP. It will be demonstrated
	that income net such expenditures will account for total welfare
	changes only if the supply of the non- market good is constant,
	while the expenditures should not be subtracted if external factors
	are constant. We argue that the latter case will apply to most use
	of the GDP incator for planning purposes. <p> We also consider a
	model of disamenities of urbanization, and argue that there are
	important shortcomings in the methods used to estimate these. Daly
	and Cobb's estimate consideres only a selection of disamenities,
	and only those that are negative. We also argue that Nordhaus and

Title: R&D, Spillovers and Performance among Heterogenous Firms. An
	Empirical Study Using Microdata

	Panel Data; Microdata
Classification-JEL: D24
Abstract: Empirical research has established that there is a significant,
	positive relationship between productivity growth and R&D-
	expenditure at the firm level. Yet, while interesting, the
	conventional production function approach applied in such studies
	has some well known limitations. <br> This paper attempts to
	provide new insights into three main issues: (i) Heterogeneity in
	production relationships, in particular differences in innovative
	opportunities, across firms are emphasized throughout. (ii) There
	tends to be a correlation between investment decisions and the
	error term in production function regressions (even when specified
	in a growth rate form), that will bias the estimated parameters.
	The paper handles this problem more carefully than usual, by
	dealing explicitly with uncertainty and expectation- errors by
	means of instrumental variable estimation. (iii) R&D is an
	investment activity which involves significant adjustment costs.
	<br> This paper presents a new specifications of adjustment costs,
	where rapid changes in the R&D- program reduce the growth in
	knowledge capital. The results confirm the view that there are
	significant differences in innovative opportunities across firms
	(within narrowly defined industries). There is clear evidence that
	R&D- activity in a firm improves its performance. The results
	suggest that R&D- activities in competing firms will have a
	positive or negative effect on a firm's performance, depending on
	whether the firm is technologically advanced or not.

Classification-JEL: C23; D21; D43; L61
Abstract: The hypothesis of market power in the Norwegian primary aluminium
	industry is tested using plant-level panel data. Economies of scale
	are found to be present, and Norwegian aluminium plants charge a
	procyclical price-cost margin that significantly exceeds zero.
	Consequently, the simple competitive hypothesis is rejected. The
	hypothesis that products are differentiated is not rejected, since
	several plants are found to charge a price permanently over the
	world market price. A decline in industry concentration
	internationally, which is assumed to increase the degree of
	competition, has no significant effect on the price-cost margins of
	Norwegian plants.

Abstract: Based on the methodology developed by Hodrick & Prescott (1980),
	it is shown that monetary activity in Norway by no means obeys the
	cyclical patterns described by Lucas (1983). By constructing annual
	time series covering monetary data from 1900 to 1992, combined with
	the use of varying filtering parameter values, it is demonstrated
	that only credit volume has followed a procyclical pattern.
	Furthermore, prices are found to be countercyclical during the post
	war period. Tests of relative volatility and cyclical skewness are
	presented as well as prospects for future studies of business
	cycles in Norway based on historical data.

Abstract: Hall's (1988) approach to study price- cost margins is adapted to
	simultaneously estimate price- cost margins and scale economies
	from a panel of plant level data. The paper shows how this
	methodology provides a very flexible framework with only a few,
	economically interesting parameters to be estimated. The
	econometric model is tested and estimated on different panels of
	plants, covering most manufacturing industries in Norway 1980- 90.
	The GMM- estimates suggest significant, but quite small, markups in
	all industries. No industry exhibits increasing returns to scale;
	the average firm (in all industries) seems to face constant or
	moderately decreasing returns to scale. Estimates suggest that
	there is more variation in the price- cost margins and scale
	coefficients within the fairly narrow industry groups investigated,
	as compared to between the industry groups. <p> * This paper is a
	substantially revised version of Klette (1993).

Author-Workplace-Homepage: http://www.ssb.no/english/research/
Keywords: Carbon Taxes; Exhaustible Resources; Petroleum Wealth
Classification-JEL: H23; Q30; Q40
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to examine the impacts of a global
	carbon tax on fossil fuel markets. In particular, the effect on the
	Norwegian, as well as the global, petroleum wealth is studied. Most
	empirical models of fossil fuel markets either use an exogenous
	price path, or model the supply side as being independent of future
	expectations. Hence, they are not able to test how the
	exhaustibility feature of fossil fuels affects the sharing of the
	tax burden between producers and consumers. We study a simple,
	dynamic model of a competitive fossil fuel market, and we first
	derive some general theoretical results regarding how a carbon tax
	may affect the producer and consumer prices. Then, simulations of
	the global oil market indicate that a fixed carbon tax of e.g.
	$10/barrel of oil may reduce the petroleum wealth of the average
	oil producer by 33-42%. The Norwegian petroleum wealth may decrease
	more than this, by 47-68%. The latter reduction may correspond to a
	yearly income loss of about 3% of Norwegian GDP. However, the
	figures should only be considered as very rough estimates, because
	of the simplistic nature of the model.

Keywords: Scale economies; imperfect competition; econometric
	misspecification; price heterogeneity.
Classification-JEL: C23; D24.
Abstract: This paper explores the inconsistency of common scale estimators
	when output is proxied by deflated sales, based on a common output
	deflator across firms. The problems arise when firms operate in an
	imperfectly competitive environment and prices differ between
	firms. In particular, we show that this problem reveals itself as a
	downward bias in the scale estimates obtained from production
	function regressions, under a variety of assumptions about the
	pattern of technology, demand and factor price shocks. The result
	also holds for scale estimates obtained from cost functions. The
	analysis is carried one step further by adding a model of product
	demand. Within this augmented model we examine the probability
	limit of the scale estimate obtained from an ordinary production
	function regression. This analysis reveals that the OLS estimate
	will be biased towards unity - or possibly a value below unity. We
	have included an empirical section which illustrates the issues.
	The empirical analysis presents a tentative approach to avoid the
	problems discussed in the theoretical part of this paper.

Keywords: Extrapolative Expectations; Microeconomic Data; Tendency Surveys
Classification-JEL: C21; C42; D84
Abstract: The hypothesis of extrapolative expectations is tested directly
	using Norwegian microeconomic data on firms' expectations of the
	prices of own products in domestic and export markets and
	expectations of demand for own products in domestic and export
	markets. The data, which are categorical, are taken from a survey
	of firms in manufacturing and mining. Different versions of
	extrapolative models are discussed, i.e. the general extrapolative
	model, the pure adaptive scheme and the error-learning model. The
	data are analyzed by means of different measures of association in
	cross-tables and loglinear probability models. Because of the
	sample size and the distribution of observations through out the
	table, statistical conclusions cannot be drawn for the hypothesis
	of adaptive expectations. For this version of extrapolative
	expectations, only descriptive measures are provided. Our empirical
	results support a general version of extrapolative expectations.
	The restrictions on the lag structure which take us from the
	general version to the model of adaptive expectations do, when
	confronted with our data, seem to be too restrictive.

Classification-JEL: C23; J23
Abstract: This paper examines panel data modelling with latent variables in
	analyzing log-linear relations between inputs and output of firms.
	Our particular focus is on (i) the "increasing returns to scale
	puzzle" for labour input and (ii) the GMM estimation in the context
	of errors-in-variables and panel data. The IV's used for the
	observed log-differenced output are log output (in level form) for
	other years than those to which the difference(s) refer. Flexible
	assumptions are made about the second order moments of the errors,
	the random coefficients, and other latent variables, allowing,
	inter alia, for arbitrary heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation up
	to the first order of the errors-in-variables. We compare OLS,
	2SLS, and GMM estimates of the average input response elasticity
	(which in some cases can be interpreted as an average inverse scale
	elasticity), and investigate whether year specific estimates differ
	substantially from those obtained when data for all years are
	combined. The results confirm the "increasing returns to scale
	puzzle" for labour input (measured in three different ways), but
	indicate approximately constant returns to scale when we consider
	the material input response. This indicates non-homotheticity of
	the production technology.

	identifies different sources which may cause the optimal public
	price structure to deviate from marginal cost pricing in a

	price structure includes an implicit subsidy on commodities which
	are consumed relatively intensely by transfer-deserving households,
	whereas the same price structure involves an implicit tax on

Classification-JEL: E21
Abstract: This paper deals with optimal consumption over time. The starting
	point is a dynamic utility function which is exponential where the
	exponent is quadratic in the observable consumption outlays. The
	approach is shown to be a generalization of Hall's formulation of
	the consumption relation. While Hall's structural form of
	consumption is independent of the income process, we show that this
	no longer holds. On the contrary, parameters of the income process
	are shown to affect the parameters of the consumption process in an
	essential way. The paper also argues for a stochastic maximum
	principle. In addition to generating the optimal current decisions,
	this principle produces simultaneously optimal estimates of the
	future values of the decision variables. This interplay of
	optimization and prediction is interesting. The paper terminates
	with statistical testing procedures which compare the testing of
	hypotheses deduced by Hall with testing of those derived in the
	present paper.

	relationship combining two rich, new sources of firm and
	plant-level data. Among the substantial empirical findings are (i)
	R&D has a positive and significant effect on performance, (ii) the
	estimates suggest that the appropriable part of knowledge capital
	depreciate at a rate of 0.2, (iii) there are visible spillover
	effects of R&D across LBs within a firm (economies of scope in

	that belong to the same interlocking group of firms.

Abstract: There is no consensus on how to measure interpersonally
	comparable, cardinal utility. Despite of this, people repeatedly
	make welfare evaluations in their everyday lives. However, people
	do not always agree on such evaluations, and this is one important
	reason for political disagreements. Thus, to keep in control of the
	normative premises, decision makers may prefer information which
	can be used as input in an arbitrary social welfare function to
	information which is the output from a social welfare function
	specified by the analyst. In this paper we try to identify
	sufficient welfare indicators; information which enable decision
	makers to arrive at welfare evaluations of social states or
	projects, according to their own ethical beliefs. Our conclusion is
	that providing factual information about different population
	groups; their social state, size, and characteristics, may be
	better for this purpose than the more traditional approach of
	focusing on ordinal utility information.

Abstract: A cooperative bargaining model is adapted to the setting of local

	The origin of intertia in the model is ascribed to incrementalism
	or adjustment costs in the disagreement points of the Nash
	solution. Using the method of ordinary least squares, the model is
	estimated on sample data for the period 1973-1991. Different
	hypotheses regarding the disagreement point formation are tested,
	and the pure incrementalist model is encompassed by a more general
	partial adjustment model, implying that some other mechanism than
	just preservation of the status quo is operative. It is found that
	local government consumption, the capital stock and the net debt in
	the long run are stabilized relative to disposable income. Finally,
	results form model simulations are reported.

Abstract: In this paper we analyze household's car ownership and private
	car use decisions in a model proposed by de Jong (1990). The model,
	which incorporates variable and fixed costs of car use, can be used
	to predict the effects of changes in policy measures on the car
	stock and aggregate use. The model is estimated on Norwegian
	household data for 1985.

Abstract: We examine estimation of a model of producer behavior in the
	presence of correlated measurement errors in the regressors. Scale
	economies and price-cost margins are estimated from a set of panel
	data for manufacturing plants. The paper presents a somewhat new
	model for estimation of these parameters which is highly flexible
	but with a simple regression structure. Perhaps the most important
	contribution of the paper is some new results on deriving parameter
	bounds for a regression model with errors in variables. In
	particular, we consider the case where the measurement errors might
	be correlated. We derive asymptotic standard errors for the
	parameter bounds. These asymptotic standard errors are compared to
	bootstrap estimates. Our new results on parameter bounds are
	applied to the estimation of the model of producer behavior.

Abstract: The intangible asset theory of foreign direct investment holds
	that firms expand abroad to garner additional returns to intangible
	assets such as proprietary process or product technology or a
	strong reputation. I explore Norwegian manufacturing data for
	evidence that foreign owners are realizing returns to intangible
	assets. Foreign owners of Norwegian manufacturing establishments
	are clustered in industries that rely on such assets and, within
	narrowly-defined industries, differ from their domestic
	counterparts by being larger and using physical and human capital
	more intensively. My finding that foreign-owned establishments are
	approximately 2% more productive than their domestic counterparts
	is suspect evidence for the intangible assets theory because it
	relies crucially on the accuracy of the estimate of the scale
	elasticity, and such estimates are subject to well-known omitted
	variables and errors-in-variables biases. I show how the foreign
	ownership advantage varies with alternative assumptions about
	economies of scale, and find that under reasonable assumptions
	about scale economies it disappears. I conclude that foreign-owned
	establishments are larger and more productive, but cannot yet sort
	out the relationships between size, foreign-ownership, and
	productivity. I find that those establishments acquired by
	foreigners tend to be of average productivity and above-average
	size, but find no evidence that acquisition leads to a productivity
	improvement. In addition, I find that aggregating rented and owned
	capital in a capital services measure does not significantly affect
	the productivity comparison.

Title: The Volatility of Oil Wealth under Uncertainty about Parameter

Abstract: Aslaksen et al. (1990) concluded that the petroleum wealth of
	Norway, and hence the permanent income from petroleum extraction,
	was as uncertain as the yearly oil revenues. Their conclusion was
	based on wealth estimates using official price projections, with no
	independent empirical analysis of the oil price process. In this
	paper the wealth estimates are based on an empirical analysis of
	the oil prices. We find that the best estimate of the roots of the
	price process indicates a more stable wealth than the conclusions
	in Aslaksen et al. (1990) indicated. If we introduce a possible
	shift in the price process at the time of OPEC I in 1974, the price
	shift in OPEC II, has an indirect effect on petroleum wealth
	through its influence on the best parameter estimate. This indirect
	effect is considerable, and the main conclusions from Aslaksen et
	al. (1990) are maintained in spite of the low roots.

Title: Investment and Financial Constraints An Empirical Analysis of

Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between a firm's
	investment decision and its financial situation. We present a model
	of investment, where the cost of external finance is increasing in
	the debt ratio. The model is estimated using a panel of Norwegian
	manufacturing establishments for the period 1977-1990. The
	empirical analysis finds a positive relationship between a firm's
	debt ratio and its marginal return to capital. This indicates that
	firms with high debt ratios have higher costs of finance than other
	firms. Including convex adjustment costs in the model did not
	change this result, as the size of the adjustment costs was found
	to be very small.

Abstract: A precautionary saving model is extended to include old-age
	pensions and provides the framework for an empirical analysis of
	the relation between old-age pensions and private consumption.
	Norwegian macro-data for socioeconomic groups of households are
	used to estimate consumption functions for workers and pensioners.
	We find no effects from various approximations of expected
	pension-income to consumption for workers, but results indicate
	some influence from labour-income uncertainty. Income elasticities
	are found to differ considerably between the two groups of
	households. Implications for effects on aggregate saving from
	pension policies and of ageing populations are discussed.

Title: Depletion of Fossil Fuels and the impact of Global Warming

Abstract: This paper combines the theory of optimal extraction of
	exhaustible resources with the theory of greenhouse externalities,
	to analyse problems of global warming when the supply side is
	considered. The optimal carbon tax will initially rise but
	eventually fall when the externality is positively related to the
	stock of carbon in the atmosphere. It is shown that the tax will
	start falling before the stock of carbon in the atmosphere reaches
	its maximum. If, on the other hand, the greenhouse externality
	depends on the rate of change in the atmospheric stock of carbon,
	the evolution of the optimal carbon tax is more complex. It can
	even be optimal to subsidise carbon emissions to avoid future rapid
	changes in the stock of carbon, and therefore future damages. If
	the externality is related to the stock of carbon in the atmosphere
	and there exists a non-polluting backstop technology, it will be
	optimal to extract and consume fossil fuels even when the price of
	fossil fuels is equal to the price of the backstop. The total
	extraction is the same as when the externality is ignored, but in
	the presence of the greenhouse effect, it will be optimal to slow
	the extraction and spread it over a longer period.
