Title: Rationalizing and Curve-Fitting Demand Data with Quasilinear
 Utilities
Abstract: In the empirical and theoretical literature a consumer's
 utility function is often assumed to be quasilinear. In this paper
 we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for testing if the
 consumer acts as if she is maximizing a quasilinear utility function
 over her budget set. If the consumer's choices are inconsistent with
 maximizing a quasilinear utility function over her budget set, then
 we compute the "best" quasilinear rationalization of her choices.

Title: The Strong Law of Demand
Abstract: We show that a demand function is derived from maximizing a
 quasilinear utility function subject to a budget constraint if and
 only if the demand function is cyclically monotone.  On finite data
 sets consisting of pairs of market prices and consumption vectors,
 this result is equivalent to a solution of the Afriat inequalities
 where all the marginal utilities of income are equal.
 
 We explore the implications of these results for maximization of a
 random quasilinear utility function subject to a budget constraint
 and for representative agent general equilibrium models.
 
 The duality theory for cyclically monotone demand is developed using
 the Legendre-Fenchel transform. In this setting, a consumer's surplus
 is measured by the conjugate of her utility function.

Title: The Elusive Empirical Shadow of Growth Convergence
Abstract: Two groups of applied econometricians have figured prominently
 in empirical studies of growth convergence. In terms of a popular
 caricature, one group believes it has found a black hat of convergence
 (evidence for growth convergence) in the dark room of economic growth,
 even though the hat may not exist (the task may be futile). A second
 group believes it has found a black coat of divergence (evidence
 against growth convergence) even though this object also may not exist
 (empirical reality, including the nature of growth divergence, is ever
 more complex than the models used to characterize it). The present
 paper seeks to light a candle to see whether there is a hat, a coat or
 another object of identifiable clothing in the room of regional and
 multi-country economic growth. After our examination, we find that the
 candle power of applied econometrics is too low to clearly distinguish
 a black hat in the huge dark room of economic growth. However, in our
 theory model, we find an important new role for heterogeneity over
 time and across economies in the transitional dynamics of economic
 growth; and, in our empirical work, these transitional dynamics reveal
 an elusive shadow of the conditional convergence hat in both US
 regional and inter-country OECD growth patterns.

Title: Laws and Limits of Econometrics
Abstract: We start by discussing some general weaknesses and
 limitations of the econometric approach. A template from sociology is
 used to formulate six laws that characterize mainstream activities of
 econometrics and the scientific limits of those activities, we
 discuss some proximity theorems that quantify by means of explicit
 bounds how close we can get to the generating mechanism of the data
 and the optimal forecasts of next period observations using a finite
 number of observations. The magnitude of the bound depends on the
 characteristics of the model and the trajectory of the observed data.
 The results show that trends are more elusive to model than stationary
 processes in the sense that the proximity bounds are larger. By
 contrast, the bounds are of smaller order for models that are
 unidentified or nearly unidentified, so that  lack or near lack of
 identification may not be as fatal to the use of a model in practice
 as some recent results on inference suggest, we look at one possible
 future of econometrics that involves the use of advanced econometric
 methods interactively by way of a web browser. With these methods
 users may access a suite of econometric methods and data sets online.
 They may also upload data to remote servers and by simple web browser
 selections initiate the implementation of advanced econometric
 software algorithms, returning the results online and by file and
 graphics downloads.

Title: Generalized Potentials and Robust Sets of Equilibria
Abstract: This paper introduces generalized potential functions of
 complete information games and studies the robustness of sets of
 equilibria to incomplete information. A set of equilibria of a
 complete information game is robust if every incomplete information
 game where payoffs are almost always given by the complete
 information game has an equilibrium which generates behavior close to
 some equilibrium in the set. This paper provides sufficient conditions
 for the robustness of sets of equilibria in terms of argmax sets of
 generalized potential functions and shows that the sufficient
 conditions generalize the existing sufficient conditions for the
 robustness of equilibria.

Title: Vision and Influence in Econometrics: John Denis Sargan
Abstract: Denis Sargan's intellectual influence in econometrics is
 discussed and some of his visions for the future of econometrics are
 considered in this memorial article. One of Sargan's favorite topics
 in econometric theory was finite sample theory, including both exact
 theory and various types of asymptotic expansions. We provide some
 summary discussion of asymptotic expansions of the type that Sargan
 developed in this field and give explicit representations of Sargan's
 formula for the Edgeworth expansion in the case of an econometric
 estimator that can be written as a smooth function of sample moments
 whose distributions themselves have Edgeworth expansions.

Title: Jackknifing Bond Option Prices
Abstract: In continuous time specifications, the prices of interest
 rate derivative securities depend crucially on the mean reversion
 parameter of the associated interest rate diffusion equation. This
 parameter is well known to be subject to estimation bias when
 standard methods like maximum likelihood (ML) are used. The
 estimation bias can be substantial even in very large samples and it
 translates into a bias in pricing bond options and other derivative
 securities that is important in practical work. The present paper
 proposes a very general method of bias reduction for pricing bond
 options that is based on Quenouille's (1956) jackknife. We show how
 the method can be applied directly to the options price itself as
 well as the coefficients in continuous time models. The method is
 implemented and evaluated here in the Cox, Ingersoll and Ross (1985)
 model, although it has much wider applicability. A Monte Carlo study
 shows that the proposed procedure achieves substantial bias
 reductions in pricing bond options with only mild increases in
 variance that do not compromise the overall gains in mean squared
 error.

 Our findings indicate that bias correction in estimation of the drift
 can be more important in pricing bond options than correct
 specification of the diffusion. Thus, even if ML or approximate ML
 can be used to estimate more complicated models, it still appears to
 be of equal or greater importance to correct for the effects on
 pricing bond options of bias in the estimation of the drift. An
 empirical application to U.S. interest rates highlights the
 differences between bond and option prices implied by the jackknife
 procedure and those implied by the standard approach. These
 differences are large and suggest that bias reduction in pricing 
options is important in practical applications.

Title: Fractional Brownian Motion as a Differentiable
 Generalized Gaussian Process
Abstract: Brownian motion can be characterized as a generalized random
 process and, as such, has a generalized derivative whose covariance
 functional is the delta function. In a similar fashion, fractional
 Brownian motion can be interpreted as a generalized random process
 and shown to possess a generalized derivative. The resulting process
 is a generalized Gaussian process with mean functional zero and
 covariance functional that can be interpreted as a fractional integral
 or fractional derivative of the delta-function.

Title: GMM Estimation of Autoregressive Roots Near Unity with Panel
 Data
Abstract: This paper investigates a generalized method of moments
 (GMM) approach to the estimation of autoregressive roots near unity
 with panel data and incidental deterministic trends. Such models
 arise in empirical econometric studies of firm size and in dynamic
 panel data modeling with weak instruments. The two moment conditions
 in the GMM approach are obtained by constructing bias corrections to
 the score functions under OLS and GLS detrending, respectively. It
 is shown that the moment condition under GLS detrending corresponds
 to taking the projected score on the Bhattacharya basis, linking the
 approach to recent work on projected score methods for models with
 infinite numbers of nuisance parameters (Waterman and Lindsay, 1998).
 Assuming that the localizing parameter takes a nonpositive value, we
 establish consistency of the GMM estimator and find its limiting
 distribution. A notable new finding is that the GMM estimator has
 convergence rate n/{1/6}, slower than /n, when the true localizing
 parameter is zero (i.e., when there is a panel unit root) and the
 deterministic trends in the panel are linear. These results, which
 rely on boundary point asymptotics, point to the continued difficulty
 of distinguishing unit roots from local alternatives, even when there
 is an infinity of additional data.

Title: Monetary Equilibrium with Missing Markets
Abstract: We consider a two-period model with missing assets and
 missing market links, in which money plays a central role and is
 linked to every instrument in the economy. If there are enough missing
 market links relative to the ratio of outside to inside money, then
 monetary equilibrium (ME) exists and money has positive value. The
 nonexistence of GEI (of the underlying economy) shows up as a
 liquidity trap in terms of the ME. In sharp contrast to GEI, the ME
 are generally determinate not only in terms of real, but also
 financial, variables.

Title: Testing for a New Economy in the 1990s
Abstract: This paper examines how much structural change there was in the U.S.
 economy in the last half of the 1990s. The results are consistent with the
 hypothesis that there was only one major structural change, namely the huge
 increase in stock prices relative to earnings. All other large changes can
 be explained by this change. There is no obvious reason for the large
 increase in stock prices relative to earnings. Increased productivity
 growth does not appear to be an answer since the data show that there was
 only a modest increase in long run productivity growth in the last half of
 the 1990s. Also, earnings growth and the share of earnings in the economy
 were not unusually large.

Title: The Economic Consequences of a War with Iraq
Abstract: Much has been written about the national-security aspects
 of a potential conflict in Iraq, but there are no studies of the cost.
 A review of several past wars indicates that nations historically have
 consistently underestimated the cost of military conflicts. This study
 reviews the potential costs of a conflict including the postwar
 expenses that might be required for occupation, humanitarian
 assistance, reconstruction, nation-building, along with the
 implications for oil markets and macroeconomic activity. It considers
 two potential scenarios that span the potential outcomes, ranging

Title: One Simple Test of Samuelson's Dictum for the Stock Market
Abstract: Samuelson [1998] offered the dictum that the stock market is
 "micro efficient" but "macro inefficient." That is, the efficient
 markets hypothesis works much better for individual stocks than it
 does for the aggregate stock market. In this paper, we present one
 simple test, based both on regressions and on a simple scatter diagram
 that vividly illustrates that there is some truth to Samuelson's
 dictum.  The data comprise all U.S. firms on the CRSP tape that have
 survived since 1926.

Title: From Efficient Market Theory to Behavioral Finance
Abstract: The efficient markets theory reached the height of its
 dominance in academic circles around the 1970s. Faith in this theory
 was eroded by a succession of discoveries of anomalies, many in the
 1980s, and of evidence of excess volatility of returns. Finance
 literature in this decade and after suggests a more nuanced view of
 the value of the efficient markets theory, and, starting in the 1990s,
 a blossoming of research on behavioral finance. Some important
 developments in the 1990s and recently include feedback theories,
 models of the interaction of smart money with ordinary investors, and
 evidence on obstacles to smart money.

Title: Adaptive Local Polynomial Whittle Estimation of Long-range
 Dependence
Abstract: The local Whittle (or Gaussian semiparametric) estimator of
 long range dependence, proposed by Kunsch (1987) and analyzed by
 Robinson (1995a), has a relatively slow rate of convergence and a
 finite sample bias that can be large. In this paper, we generalize
 the local Whittle estimator to circumvent these problems. Instead of
 approximating the short-run component of the spectrum, phi(lambda),
 by a constant in a shrinking neighborhood of frequency zero, we
 approximate its logarithm by a polynomial. This leads to a "local
 polynomial Whittle" (LPW) estimator. We specify a data-dependent
 adaptive procedure that adjusts the degree of the polynomial to the
 smoothness of phi(lambda) at zero and selects the bandwidth. The
 resulting "adaptive LPW" estimator is shown to achieve the optimal
 rate of convergence, which depends on the smoothness of phi(lambda)
 at zero, up to a logarithmic factor.

Title: College Football Rankings and Market Efficiency
Abstract: The results in this paper show that various college football
 ranking systems have useful independent information for predicting the
 outcomes of games. Optimal weights for the systems are estimated, and the
 use of these weights produces a predictive system that is more accurate
 than any of the individual systems. The results also provide a fairly
 precise estimate of the size of the home field advantage. These results
 may be of interest to the Bowl Championship Series in choosing which teams
 to play in the national championship game. The results also show, however,
 that none of the systems, including the optimal combination, contains any
 useful information that is not in the final Las Vegas point spread. It is
 argued in the paper that this is a fairly strong test of the efficiency of
 the college football betting market.

Title: Demography and the Long-run Predictability of the Stock Market
Abstract: Stock market price/earnings ratios should be influenced by
 demography. Since demography is predictable, stock returns should be
 as well. We provide a simple stochastic OLG model with a cyclical
 structure that generates cyclical P/E ratios. We calibrate the model
 to roughly fit the cyclical features of historical P/E ratios.

Title: The Value of Benchmarking
Abstract: We consider the provision of venture capital in a dynamic
 model with multiple research stages, where time and investment needed
 to meet each benchmark are unknown. The allocation of funds is subject
 moral hazard. The optimal contract provides for incentive payments
 linked to attaining the next benchmark, which must be increasing in
 the funding horizon of each stage. Benchmarking reduces agency costs,
 directly by shortening the agent's guaranteed funding horizon, and
 indirectly via an implicit incentive effect of information rents in
 future financing rounds.

 The ex ante need to provide incentives and the venture capitalist's
 desire to cut information rents ex post create a hold-up conflict,
 which can be overcome by providing all funds in every stage in a
 single up-front payment. Empirical patterns of the evolution of
 financing rounds and research intensity over the lifetime of a
 project are explained as optimal choices: the optimal capital
 allocated and the funding horizon are increasing from one stage to
 the next. This emphasizes the notion that early stages are the
 riskiest in an innovative venture.

Title: Higher-order Improvements of the Parametric
 Bootstrap for Long-memory Gaussian Processes
Abstract: This paper determines coverage probability errors of both
 delta method and parametric bootstrap confidence intervals (CIs) for
 the covariance parameters of stationary long-memory Gaussian time
 series. CIs for the long-memory parameter d_0 are included. The
 results establish that the bootstrap provides higher-order
 improvements over the delta method. Analogous results are given for
 tests. The CIs and tests are based on one or other of two approximate
 maximum likelihood estimators. The first estimator solves the
 first-order conditions with respect to the covariance parameters of
 a "plug-in" log-likelihood function that has the unknown mean
 replaced by the sample mean. The second estimator does likewise
 for a plug-in Whittle log-likelihood.

 The magnitudes of the coverage probability errors for one-sided
 bootstrap CIs for covariance parameters for long-memory time series
 are shown to be essentially the same as they are with iid data. This
 occurs even though the mean of the time series cannot be estimated
 at the usual n^{1/2} rate.

Title: Best Response Equivalence
Abstract: Two games are best-response equivalent if they have the same
 best-response correspondence. We provide a characterization of when
 two games are best-response equivalent. The characterizations exploit
 a dual relationship between payoff differences and beliefs. Some
 "potential game" arguments (cf. Monderer and Shapley, 1996, Games.
 Econ. Behav. 14, 124-143) rely only on the property that potential
 games are best-response equivalent to identical interest games. Our
 results show that a large class of games are best-response equivalent
 to identical interest games, but are not potential games. Thus we
 show how some existing potential game arguments can be extended.

Title: Econometric Methods for Endogenously Sampled Time Series: The
 Case of Commodity Price Speculation in the Steel Market
Abstract: This paper studies the econometric problems associated with
 estimation of a stochastic process that is endogenously sampled. Our
 interest is to infer the law of motion of a discrete-time stochastic
 process {p_t} that is observed only at a subset of times
 {t_1,...,t_n} that depend on the outcome of a probabilistic sampling
 rule that depends on the history of the process as well as other
 observed covariates x_t. We focus on a particular example where p_t
 denotes the daily wholesale price of a standardized steel product.
 However there are no formal exchanges or centralized markets where
 steel is traded and pt can be observed. Instead nearly all steel
 transaction prices are a result of private bilateral negotiations
 between buyers and sellers, typically intermediated by middlemen
 known as steel service centers. Even though there is no central
 record of daily transactions prices in the steel market, we do
 observe transaction prices for a particular firm -- a steel service
 center that purchases large quantities of steel in the wholesale
 market for subsequent resale in the retail market. The endogenous
 sampling problem arises from the fact that the firm only records p_t
 on the days that it purchases steel. We present a parametric analysis
 of this problem under the assumption that the timing of steel
 purchases is part of an optimal trading strategy that maximizes the
 firm's expected discounted trading profits. We derive a parametric
 partial information maximum likelihood (PIML) estimator that solves
 the endogenous sampling problem and efficiently estimates the unknown
 parameters of a Markov transition probability that determines the law
 of motion for the underlying {p_t} process. The PIML estimator also
 yields estimates of the structural parameters that determine the
 optimal trading rule. We also introduce an alternative consistent,
 less efficient, but computationally simpler simulated minimum distance
 (SMD) estimator that avoids high dimensional numerical integrations
 required by the PIML estimator. Using the SMD estimator, we provide
 estimates of a truncated lognormal AR(1) model of the wholesale price
 processes for particular types of steel plate. We use this to infer
 the share of the middleman's discounted profits that are due to
 markups paid by its retail customers, and the share due to price
 speculation. The latter measures the firm's success in forecasting
 steel prices and in timing its purchases in order to "buy low and sell
 high'." The more successful the firm is in speculation (i.e., in
 strategically timing its purchases), the more serious are the
 potential biases that would result from failing to account for the
 endogeneity of the sampling process.

Title: More Efficient Kernel Estimation in Nonparametric Regression
 with Autocorrelated Errors
Abstract: We propose a modification of kernel time series regression
 estimators that improves efficiency when the innovation process is
 autocorrelated. The procedure is based on a pre-whitening
 transformation of the dependent variable that has to be estimated
 from the data. We establish the asymptotic distribution of our
 estimator under weak dependence conditions. It is shown that the
 proposed estimation procedure is more efficient than the conventional
 kernel method. We also provide simulation evidence to suggest that
 gains can be achieved in moderate sized samples.

Title: Error Bounds and Asymptotic Expansions for Toeplitz Product
 Functionals of Unbounded Spectra
Abstract: This paper establishes error orders for integral limit
 approximations to traces of powers to the pth order) of products of
 Toeplitz matrices. Such products arise frequently in the analysis of
 stationary time series and in the development of asymptotic
 expansions. The elements of the matrices are Fourier transforms of
 functions which we allow to be bounded, unbounded, or even to vanish
 on [-pi,pi], thereby including important cases such as the spectral
 functions of fractional processes. Error rates are also given in the
 case in which the matrix product involves inverse matrices. The rates
 are sharp up to an arbitrarily small epsilon > 0. The results
 improve on the o(1) rates obtained in earlier work for analogous
 products. For the p = 1 case, an explicit second order asymptotic
 expansion is found for a quadratic functional of the autocovariance
 sequences of stationary long memory time series. The order of
 magnitude of the second term in this expansion is shown to depend on
 the long memory parameters. It is demonstrated that the pole in the
 first order approximation is removed by the second order term, which
 provides a substantially improved approximation to the original
 functional.

Title: Limit Theorems for Estimating the Parameters of Differentiated
 Product Demand Systems
Abstract: We provide an asymptotic distribution theory for a class of
 Generalized Method of Moments estimators that arise in the study of
 differentiated product markets when the number of observations is
 associated with the number of products within a given market. We
 allow for three sources of error: the sampling error in estimating
 market shares, the simulation error in approximating the shares
 predicted by the model, and the underlying model error. The limiting
 distribution of the parameter estimator is normal provided the size
 of the consumer sample and the number of simulation draws grow at a
 large enough rate relative to the number of products. We specialise
 our distribution theory to the Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes (1995)
 random coefficient logit model and a pure characteristic model. The
 required rates differ for these two frequently used demand models. A
 small Monte Carlo study shows that the difference in asymptotic
 properties of the two models are reflected in the models' small sample
 properties. These differences impact directly on the computational
 burden of the two models.

Title: Unmediated Communication in Games with Complete and
 Incomplete Information
Abstract: In this paper we study the effects of adding unmediated
 communication to static, finite games of complete and incomplete
 information. We characterize S^{U}(G), the set of outcomes of a game
 G, that are induced by sequential equilibria of cheap talk extensions.
 A cheap talk extension of G is an extensive-form game in which players
 communicate before playing G. A reliable mediator is not available
 and players exchange private or public messages that do not affect
 directly their payoffs. We first show that if G is a game of complete
 information with five or more players and rational parameters, then
 S^{U}(G) coincides with the set of correlated equilibria of G. Next,
 we demonstrate that if G is a game of incomplete information with at
 least five players, rational parameters and full support (i.e. all
 profiles of types have positive probability), then S^{U}(G) is equal
 to the set of communication equilibria of G.

Title: The Block-block Bootstrap: Improved Asymptotic Refinements
Abstract: The asymptotic refinements attributable to the block
 bootstrap for time series are not as large as those of the
 nonparametric iid bootstrap or the parametric bootstrap. One reason
 is that the independence between the blocks in the block bootstrap
 sample does not mimic the dependence structure of the original
 sample. This is the join-point problem. 

 In this paper, we propose a method of solving this problem. The idea
 is not to alter the block bootstrap. Instead, we alter the original
 sample statistics to which the block bootstrap is applied. We
 introduce block statistics that possess join-point features that are
 similar to those of the block bootstrap versions of these statistics.
 We refer to the application of the block bootstrap to block statistics
 as the block-block bootstrap. The asymptotic refinements of the
 block-block bootstrap are shown to be greater than those obtained with
 the block bootstrap and close to those obtained with the nonparametric
 iid bootstrap and parametric bootstrap.

Title: End-of-Sample Instability Tests
Abstract: This paper considers tests for structural instability of
 short duration, such as at the end of the sample. The key feature of
 the testing problem is that the number, m, of observations in the
 period of potential change is relatively small -- possibly as small
 as one. The well-known F test of Chow (1960) for this problem only
 applies in a linear regression model with normally distributed iid
 errors and strictly exogenous regressors, even when the total number
 of observations, n + m, is large.
 
 We generalize the F test to cover regression models with much more
 general error processes, regressors that are not strictly exogenous,
 and estimation by instrumental variables as well as least squares.
 In addition, we extend the F test to nonlinear models estimated by
 generalized method of moments and maximum likelihood. Asymptotic
 critical values that are valid as n approaches infinity with m fixed
 are provided using a subsampling-like method. The results apply quite
 generally to processes that are strictly stationary and ergodic under
 the null hypothesis of no structural instability.

Title: The Mildest Recession: Outputs, Profits, and Stock
 Prices as the U.S. Emerges from the 2001 Recession
Abstract: This essay examines the state of the United States economy
 as it emerges from the 2001 recession. A comparison of several
 central economic variables indicates that the 2001 recession was the
 mildest recession in the postwar period. In light of highly
 differentiated characteristics of recessions, the paper suggests that
 we differentiate among downturns by a five-category "recession
 severity scale," analogous to the  Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale.
 According to this approach, the 2001 recession fits in the least
 severe box, a "category I recession," along with the 1963 and 1967
 non-recessions. The paper next examines the behavior of profits in
 recent years and shows that financial finagling has infected the
 aggregate profits numbers. Finally, the study constructs a measure of
 the forward-looking return on equities and concludes that the
 prospective real yield on equities in early 2002 is at its low point
 of the last half-century.

Abstract: An exact form of the local Whittle likelihood is studied

 for the memory parameter (d) that does not rely on tapering or
 differencing prefilters. The resulting exact local Whittle estimator
 is shown to be consistent and to have the same N(0,1/4) limit
 distribution for all values of d if the optimization covers an
 interval of width less than 9/2 and the initial value of the process
 is known.

Title: Nonlinear Log-Periodogram Regression for Perturbed Fractional
 Processes
Abstract: This paper studies fractional processes that may be perturbed
 by weakly dependent time series. The model for a perturbed fractional
 process has a components framework in which there may be components
 of both long and short memory. All commonly used estimates of the long
 memory parameter (such as log periodogram (LP) regression) may be used
 in a components model where the data are affected by weakly dependent
 perturbations, but these estimates can suffer from serious downward
 bias. To circumvent this problem, the present paper proposes a new
 procedure that allows for the possible presence of additive
 perturbations in the data. The new estimator resembles the LP
 regression estimator but involves an additional (nonlinear) term in
 the regression that takes account of possible perturbation effects in
 the data. Under some smoothness assumptions at the origin, the bias of
 the new estimator is shown to disappear at a faster rate than that of
 the LP estimator, while its asymptotic variance is inflated only by a
 multiplicative constant. In consequence, the optimal rate of
 convergence to zero of the asymptotic MSE of the new estimator is
 faster than that of the LP estimator. Some simulation results
 demonstrate the viability and the bias-reducing feature of the new
 estimator relative to the LP estimator in finite samples. A test for
 the presence of perturbations in the data is given.

Title: Dynamics of the Federal Funds Target Rate: A Nonstationary
 Discrete Choice Approach
Abstract: We apply a discrete choice approach to model the empirical
 behavior of the Federal Reserve in changing the federal funds target
 rate, the benchmark of short term market interest rates in the US.
 Our methods allow the explanatory variables to be nonstationary as
 well as stationary. This feature is particularly useful in the
 present application as many economic fundamentals that are monitored
 by the Fed and are believed to affect decisions to adjust interest
 rate targets display some nonstationarity over time. The empirical
 model is determined using the PIC criterion (Phillips and Ploberger,
 1996; Phillips, 1996) as a model selection device. The chosen model
 successfully predicts the majority of the target rate changes during
 the time period considered (1985-2001) and helps to explain strings
 of similar intervention decisions by the Fed. Based on the
 model-implied optimal interest rate, our findings suggest that there
 a lag in the Fed's reaction to economic shocks and that the Fed is
 more conservative in raising interest rates than in lowering rates.

Title: Nonstationary Discrete Choice
Abstract: This paper develops an asymptotic theory for time series
 discrete choice models with explanatory variables generated as
 integrated processes and with multiple choices and threshold
 parameters determining the choices. The theory extends recent work by
 Park and Phillips (2000) on binary choice models. As in this earlier
 work, the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator is consistent and has a
 limit theory with multiple rates of convergence (n^{3/4} and n^{1/4})
 and mixture normal distributions where the mixing variates depend on
 Brownian local time as well as Brownian motion. An extended arc sine
 limit law is given for the sample proportions of the various choices.
 The new limit law exhibits a wider range of potential behavior that
 depends on the values taken by the threshold parameters.

Title: Efficient Regression in Time Series Partial Linear Models
Abstract: This paper studies efficient estimation of partial linear
 regression in time series models. In particular, it combines two
 topics that have attracted a good deal of attention in econometrics,
 viz. spectral regression and partial linear regression, and proposes
 an efficient frequency domain estimator for partial linear models
 with serially correlated residuals. A nonparametric treatment of
 regression errors is permitted so that it is not necessary to be
 explicit about the dynamic specification of the errors other than to
 assume stationarity. A new concept of weak dependence is introduced
 based on regularity conditions on the joint density. Under these and
 some other regularity conditions, it is shown that the spectral
 estimator is root-n-consistent, asymptotically normal, and
 asymptotically efficient.

Title: Dynamic Panel Estimation and Homogeneity Testing Under Cross
 Section Dependence
Abstract: This paper deals with cross section dependence, homogeneity
 restrictions and small sample bias issues in dynamic panel
 regressions. To address the bias problem we develop a panel approach
 to median unbiased estimation that takes account of cross section
 dependence. The new estimators given here considerably reduce the
 effects of bias and gain precision from estimating cross section
 error correlation. The paper also develops an asymptotic theory for
 tests of coefficient homogeneity under cross section dependence, and
 proposes a modified Hausman test to test for the presence of
 homogeneous unit roots. An orthogonalization procedure is developed
 to remove cross section dependence and permit the use of conventional
 and meta unit root tests with panel data. Some simulations
 investigating the finite sample performance of the estimation and test
 procedures are reported.

Title: Valid Edgeworth Expansions for the Whittle Maximum Likelihood
 Estimator for Stationary Long-memory Gaussian Time Series
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the validity of an Edgeworth expansion
 to the distribution of the Whittle maximum likelihood estimator for
 stationary long-memory Gaussian models with unknown parameter theta
 in Theta subset R^{d_{theta}} . The error of the (s-2)-order expansion
 is shown to be o(n^{(s-2)/2}) -- the usual iid rate -- for a wide range
 of models, including the popular ARFIMA(p,d,q) models. The expansion
 is valid under mild assumptions on the behavior of spectral density
 and its derivatives in the neighborhood of the origin. As a by-product,
 we generalize a Theorem by Fox and Taqqu (1987) concerning the
 asymptotic behavior of Toeplitz matrices.
 
 Lieberman, Rousseau, and Zucker (2002) (LRZ) establish a valid
 Edgeworth expansion for the maximum likelihood estimator for
 stationary long-memory Gaussian models. For a significant class of
 models, their expansion is shown to have an error of o(n-1). The
 results given here improve upon those of LRZ in that the results
 provide an Edgeworth expansion for an asymptotically efficient
 estimator, as LRZ do, but the error of the expansion is shown to be
 o(n^{-(s-2)/2}), not o(n^{-1}), for a broad range of models.

Title: Partially Linear Models with Unit Roots
Abstract: This paper studies the asymptotic properties of a
 nonstationary partially linear regression model. In particular, we
 allow for covariates to enter the unit root (or near unit root) model
 in a nonparametric fashion, so that our model is an extension of the
 semiparametric model analyzed in Robinson (1988). It is proven that
 the autoregressive parameter can be estimated at rate N even though
 part of the model is estimated nonparametrically. Unit root tests
 based on the semiparametric estimate of the autoregressive parameter
 have a limiting distribution which is a mixture of a standard normal
 and the Dickey-Fuller distribution. A Monte Carlo experiment is
 conducted to evaluate the performance of the tests for various linear
 and nonlinear specifications.

 contracts with agents who would like to charge the monopoly price. The
 principal chooses between a Demsetz auction, which awards an exclusive
 contract to the agent bidding the lowest price (competition for the
 field) and having two agents provide the good under (imperfectly)
 competitive conditions (competition in the field). We obtain a simple
 sufficient condition showing unambiguously which option is best. The
 condition depends only on the shapes of the surplus function of the
 principal and the profit function of agents, and is independent of the
 particular duopoly game played ex post. We apply this condition to
 three canonical examples -- procurement, royalty contracts and
 dealerships -- and find that whenever marginal revenue for the final
 good is decreasing in the quantity sold, the principal prefers a
 Demsetz auction. Moreover, a planner who wants to maximize social
 surplus also prefers a Demsetz auction.

Title: Macroeconomic Strategy in Wartime
Abstract: In 2001-02 the United States has been hit by two quite
 different shocks, terrorism and recession. As usual in time of war,
 national defense is the highest priority for use of the country's
 resources. Although the opportunities for international warfare are
 limited, the challenges to the homeland are virtually unlimited. The
 president's fiscal year 2003 budget includes $48 billion additional
 for the military and $38 billion additional for homeland defense.
 Given the gravity of the threat, it is hard to understand why new
 expenditures are not undertaken as soon as and as large as possible.
 This would also be timely for stimulus to the economy, more effective
 than tax cuts and other proposals - with the nation in peril, the
 country is ready to make sacrifices, not to enjoy further tax
 reductions. Pearl Harbor in December 1941 occurred with the economy
 not yet recovered from the Great Depression, with unemployment still
 10 per cent. Expenditures for war were increased sharply and rapidly,
 and full employment was restored in 1943.

Title: Consistent Testing for Stochastic Dominance: A Subsampling
 Approach
Abstract: We propose a procedure for estimating the critical values of
 the Klecan, McFadden, and McFadden (1990) test for first and second
 order stochastic dominance in the general k-prospect case. Our method
 is based on subsampling bootstrap. We show that the resulting test is
 consistent. We allow for correlation amongst the prospects and for the
 observations to be autocorrelated over time. Importantly, the
 prospects may be the residuals from certain conditional models.

Title: The Health of Nations: The Contribution of Improved
 Health to Living Standards
Abstract: Nations generally measure their economic performance using
 the yardstick of national output and income. It is not widely
 recognized, however, that conventional measures of national income and
 output exclude the value of improvements in the health status of the
 population. The present study develops a methodology and presents
 preliminary estimates of how standard economic measures would change
 if they adequately reflected improvements in health status. The study
 first discusses the theory of the measurement of national income,
 examines some of the shortcomings of traditional concepts, and
 proposes a new concept called 'health income' that can be used to
 incorporate improvements in health status. The study next discusses
 how the proposed measure fits into existing theories for measuring and
 valuing consumption and health status. The study applies the new
 concepts to data for the United States over the twentieth century and
 concludes that accounting for improvements in the health status would
 substantially increase the estimated improvement in economic welfare
 for the U.S. over the twentieth century.

Title: Highway Franchising and Real Estate Values
Abstract: It has become increasingly common to allocate highway
 franchises to the bidder that offers to charge the lowest toll. Often,
 building a highway increases the value of land held by a small group
 of developers, an effect that is more pronounced with lower tolls.
 We study the welfare implications of highway franchises that benefit
 large developers, focusing on the incentives developers have to
 internalize the effect of the toll they bid on the value of their
 land. We study how participation by developers in the auction affects
 equilibrium tolls and welfare. We find that large developers bid more
 aggressively than construction companies that own no land. As long as
 land ownership is sufficiently concentrated, allowing developers in
 the auction leads to lower tolls and higher welfare. Moreover,
 collusion among developers is socially desirable. We also analyze the
 case when the franchise holder can charge lower tolls to those buying
 her land ('toll discrimination'). Relative to uniform tolls,
 discrimination decreases welfare when land is highly concentrated, but
 increases welfare otherwise. Finally, we consider the welfare
 implications of subsidies and bonuses for proposing new highway
 projects.

Title: How to Auction an Essential Facility When Underhand Integration
 Is Possible
Abstract: Regulating seaports is difficult in general, even more so for
 the weak regulatory institutions common in developing countries. For
 this reason some countries have awarded these facilities via Demsetz
 auctions, to the port operator that bids the lowest cargo-handling
 fee. A major concern with Demsetz auctions in this context, is that
 the winning operator may integrate with a shipper and monopolize the
 shipping market, by worsening the service quality for competing
 shippers. The standard policy recommendation against service quality
 discrimination is to ban the seaport from operating in the shipping
 market. The effectiveness of such prohibitions is suspect, however,
 because they can be circumvented by an (illegal) underhand agreement
 between the port operator and the shipper. In this paper we show that
 a ban on integration increases welfare if it is combined with a
 (sufficiently high) floor on the cargo-handling fee that operators
 can bid in the auction. In the absence of such a floor, however, a
 Demsetz auction is worse than no regulation at all of the bottleneck
 monopoly. Our results apply beyond the port and shipping markets, to
 any essential facility that can monopolize a downstream market. The
 results only require that profits with underhand vertical integration
 agreements be less than with legal vertical integration.

Title: I'll See It When I Believe It - A Simple Model of
 Cognitive Consistency
Abstract: Psychological experiments demonstrate that people exhibit
 a taste for consistency. Individuals are inclined to interpret new
 evidence in ways that confirm their  pre-existing beliefs. They also
 tend to change their beliefs to enhance the desirability of their
 past actions. I present a model that incorporates these effects into
 an agent's utility function and allows me to characterize when: (i)
 agents become under- and over-confident, (ii) agents exhibit excess
 stickiness in action choices, (iii) agents prefer less accurate
 signals, and (iv) agents are willing to pay in order to forgo
 signals altogether. Applications to political campaigns and
 investment decisions are explored.

Title: Valid Asymptotic Expansions for the Maximum Likelihood Estimator
 of the Parameter of a Stationary, Gaussian, Strongly Dependent Process
Abstract: We establish the validity of an Edgeworth expansion to the
 distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator of the parameter of
 a stationary, Gaussian, strongly dependent process. The result covers
 ARFIMA type models, including fractional Gaussian noise. The method of
 proof consists of three main ingredients: (i) verification of a
 suitably modified version of Durbin's (1980) general conditions for
 the validity of the Edgeworth expansion to the joint density of the
 log-likelihood derivatives; (ii) appeal to a simple result of
 Skovgaard (1986) to obtain from this an Edgeworth expansion for the
 joint distribution of the log-likelihood derivatives; (iii) appeal to
 and extension of arguments of Bhattacharya and Ghosh (1978) to
 accomplish the passage from the result on the log-likelihood
 derivatives to the result for the maximum likelihood estimators. We
 develop and make extensive use of a uniform version of Dahlhaus's
 (1989) Theorem 5.1 on products of Toeplitz matrices; the extension
 of Dahlhaus's result is of interest in its own right. A small
 numerical study of the efficacy of the Edgeworth expansion is
 presented for the case of fractional Gaussian noise.

Title: An Optimal Fair Job Assignment Problem
Abstract: We study the problem of how to allocate a set of indivisible
 objects like jobs or houses and an amount of money among a group of
 people as fairly and as efficiently as possible. A particular
 constraint for such an allocation is that every person should be
 assigned with the same number of objects in his or her bundle. The
 preferences of people depend on the bundle of objects and the quantity
 of money they take. We propose a solution to this problem, called a
 perfectly fair allocation. It is shown that every perfectly fair
 allocation is efficient and envy-free, income-fair and furthermore
 gives every person a maximal satisfaction. Then we establish a
 necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a perfectly
 fair allocation. It is shown that there exists a perfectly fair
 allocation if and only if an associated linear program problem has a
 solution. As a result, we also provide a finite method of computing a
 perfectly fair allocation.

Title: Asymptotic Theory for Multivariate GARCH Processes
Abstract: We provide in this paper asymptotic theory for the
 multivariate GARCH (p,q) process. Strong consistency of the
 quasi-maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) is established by appealing
 to conditions given in Jeantheau [19] in conjunction with a result
 given by Boussama [9] concerning the existence of a stationary and
 ergodic solution to the multivariate GARCH (p,q) process. We prove
 asymptotic normality of the quasi-MLE when the initial state is
 either stationary or fixed.

Title: On Fair Allocations and Indivisibilities
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of how to distribute a set of
 indivisible objects with an amount M of money among a number of agents
 in a fair way. We allow any number of agents and objects. Objects can
 be desirable or undesirable and the amount of money can be negative as
 well. In case M is negative, it can be regarded as costs to be shared
 by the agents. The objects with the money will be completely
 distributed among the agents in a way that each agent gets a bundle
 with at most one object if there are more agents than objects, and
 gets a bundle with at least one object if objects are no less than
 agents. We prove via an advanced fixed point argument that under
 rather mild and intuitive conditions the set of envy-free and
 efficient allocations is nonempty. Furthermore we demonstrate that if
 the total amount of money varies in an interval [X,Y], then there
 exists a connected set of fair allocations whose end points are
 allocations with sums of money equal to X and Y, respectively.
 Welfare properties are also analyzed when the total amount of money
 is modeled as a continuous variable. Our proof is based on a
 substantial generalization of the classic lemma of Knaster, Kuratowski
 and Mazurkewicz (KKM) in combinatorial topology.

 characterized by their quantity limits on contributions. Households
 signal their reliability by choosing which pool to join. In

 even though each household's deliveries are the same at all pools.
 
 The Rothschild-Stiglitz model of insurance is included as a special

 simultaneous equation models the bootstrapping approach to evaluating
 estimators initiated by Efron (1979) and the stochastic simulation approach
 to evaluating models' properties initiated by Adelman and Adelman (1959). It
 also estimates for a particular model the gain in coverage accuracy from
 using bootstrap confidence intervals over asymptotic confidence intervals.

Title: Believe and Let Believe: Axiomatic Foundations for Belief
 Dependent Utility Functionals
Abstract: A large body of experimental data demonstrates that people's
 beliefs influence their well-being beyond the indirect effect through
 the actions taken. I present a model that incorporates beliefs into
 an agent's utility function. The paper provides axiomatic foundations
 for a special class of non-additive utility indices defined over
 infinite streams of beliefs and actions. I assume that: 1) there
 exists a (null) belief that does not have any effect on future
 preferences; 2) the agent has finite memory -- only finite histories
 have an effect on current preferences; and 3) if the agent knows she
 will not be getting any additional future information, she prefers
 today's beliefs to be consistent with her past choices. Preferences
 satisfying these assumptions admit a generalized discounted utility
 representation in which all terms depend on both actions and beliefs.
 Experimental  testability of the proposed framework is also
 discussed.

Title: A Derivation of Expected Utility Maximization in the Context of
 a Game
Abstract: A decision maker faces a decision problem, or a game against
 nature. For each probability distribution over the state of the world
 (nature's strategies), she has a weak order over her acts (pure
 strategies). We formulate conditions on these weak orders guaranteeing
 that they can be jointly represented by expected utility maximization
 with respect to an almost-unique state-dependent utility, that is, a
 matrix assigning real numbers to act-state pairs. As opposed to a
 utility function that is derived in another context, the utility
 matrix derived in the game will incorporate all psychological or
 sociological determinants of well-being that result from the very fact
 that the outcomes are obtained in a given game.

Title: Subjective Distributions
Abstract: A decision maker has to choose one of several random
 variables, with uncertainty known distributions. As a Bayesian she
 behaves as if she knew the distributions. In his paper we suggest an
 axiomatic derivation of these (subjective) distributions, which is
 much more economical than the derivations by de Finetti or Savage.
 They derive the whole joint distribution of all the available random
 variables.

Title: Cognitive Foundations of Probability
Abstract: Prediction is based on past cases. We assume that a predictor
 can rank eventualities according to their plausibility given any
 memory that consists of repetitions of past cases. In a companion
 paper, we show that under mild consistency requirements, these
 rankings can be represented by numerical functions, such that the
 function corresponding to each eventuality is linear in the number of
 case repetitions. In this paper we extend the analysis to rankings of
 events. Our main result is that a cancellation condition a la de
 Finetti implies that these functions are additive with respect to union
 of disjoint sets. If the set of past cases coincides with the set of
 possible eventualities, natural conditions are equivalent to ranking
 events by their empirical frequencies. More generally, our results may
 describe how individuals form probabilistic beliefs given cases that
 are only partially pertinent to the prediction problem at hand, and
 how this subjective measure of pertinence can be derived from
 likelihood rankings.

Title: Inductive Inference: An Axiomatic Approach
Abstract: A predictor is asked to rank eventualities according to their
 plausibility, based on past cases. We assume that she can form a
 ranking given any memory that consists of finitely many past cases.
 Mild consistency requirements on these rankings imply that they have
 a numerical representation via a matrix assigning numbers to
 eventuality-case pairs, as follows. Given a memory, each eventuality
 is ranked according to the sum of the numbers in its row, over cases
 in memory. The number attached to an eventuality-case pair can be
 interpreted as the degree of support that the past case lends to the
 plausibility of the eventuality. Special instances of this result may
 be viewed as axiomatizing kernel methods for estimation of densities
 and for classification problems. Interpreting the same result for
 rankings of theories or hypotheses, rather than of specific
 eventualities, it is shown that one may ascribe to the predictor
 subjective conditional probabilities of cases given theories, such
 that her rankings of theories agree with rankings by the likelihood
 functions.

Title: The Optimal Concentration of Creditors 
Abstract: There are situations in which dispersed creditors (e.g.,
 public creditors) have more difficulties and higher costs when 
 collecting their claims in financial distress than concentrated 
 creditors (e.g., banks). Under this assumption, our model predicts 
 that measures of debt concentration relate [a] positively to 
 creditors' chosen aggregate debt collection expenditures; [b] 
 positively to management's chosen expenditures to avoid paying; [c] 
 positively to total net litigation costs/waste in financial distress; 
 and [d] positively to accomplished claim recovery by creditors (to 
 which we present some preliminary favorable empirical evidence). 
 Under additional assumptions, measures of debt concentration relate 
 [e] positively to intrinsic firm quality; [f] positively to creditor 
 monitoring and negatively to managerial waste; [g] positively to 
 optimal continuation/discontinuation choices; [h] negatively to 
 issuing marketing expenses. In a signaling model, when concentration 
 alone is not a sufficient signal, firms choose the ultimately 
 concentrated debt (i.e., a house bank) and have to pay a high 
 interest.

Title: Differentiated Products Demand Systems from a Combination of 
 Micro and Macro Data: The New Car Market 
Abstract: In this paper we provide an algorithm for estimating 
 characteristic based demand models from alternative data sources, and 
 apply it to new data on the market for passenger vehicles. We find 
 that, provided care is taken in constructing the demand system and 
 rich enough data are available, the characteristic based model can 
 both rationalize existing results and provide realistic out of sample 
 predictions.

Title: Equilibrium Selection in Global Games with Strategic 
 Complementarities 
Abstract: We study games with strategic complementarities, arbitrary 
 numbers of players and actions, and slightly noisy payoff signals. 
 We prove limit uniqueness: as the signal noise vanishes, the game 
 has a unique strategy profile that survives iterative dominance. 
 This generalizes a result of Carlsson and van Damme (1993) for 
 two player, two action games. Te surviving profile, however, may 
 depend on fine details of the structure of the noise. We provide 
 sufficient conditions on payoffs for there to be noise-independent 
 selection.

Title: Comparing Wealth Effects: The Stock Market versus the Housing 
 Market 
Abstract: We examine the link between increases in housing wealth, 
 financial wealth, and consumer spending. We rely upon a panel of 14 
 countries observed annually for various periods during the past 25 
 years and a panel of U.S. states observed quarterly during the 
 1980s and 1990s. We impute the aggregate value of owner-occupied 
 housing, the value of financial assets, and measures of aggregate 
 consumption for each of the geographic units over time. We estimate 
 regressions relating consumption to income and wealth measures, 
 finding a statistically significant and rather large effect of 
 housing wealth upon household consumption.

Title: Higher-order Improvements of the Parametric Bootstrap for 
 Markov Processes 
Abstract: This paper provides bounds on the errors in coverage 
 probabilities of maximum likelihood-based, percentile-t, 
 parametric bootstrap confidence intervals for Markov time series 
 processes. These bounds show that the parametric bootstrap for 
 Markov time series provides higher-order improvements (over 
 confidence intervals based on first order asymptotics) that are 
 comparable to those obtained by the parametric and nonparametric 
 bootstrap for iid data and are better than those obtained by the 
 block bootstrap for time series. Additional results are given 
 for Wald-based confidence regions. 
  
 The paper also shows that k-step parametric bootstrap confidence 
 intervals achieve the same higher-order improvements as the 
 standard parametric bootstrap for Markov processes. The k-step 
 bootstrap confidence intervals are computationally attractive. 
 They circumvent the need to compute a nonlinear optimization for 
 each simulated bootstrap sample. The latter is necessary to 
 implement the standard parametric bootstrap when the maximum 
 likelihood estimator solves a nonlinear optimization problem.

Title: Inflationary Bias in a Simple Stochastic Economy 
Abstract: We construct explicit equilibria for strategic market games 
 used to model an economy with fiat money, one nondurable commodity, 
 countably many time- periods, and a continuum of agents. The total 
 production of the commodity is a random variable that fluctuates from 
 period to period. In each period, the agents receive equal endowments 
 of the commodity, and sell them for cash in a market; their spending 
 determines, endogenously, the price of the commodity. All agents have 
 a common utility function, and seek to maximize their expected total 
 discounted utility from consumption.
  
 Suppose an outside bank sets an interest rate rho for loans and 
 deposits. If 1 + rho is the reciprocal of the discount factor, and if 
 agents must bid for consumption in each period before knowing their 
 income, then there is no inflation. However, there is an inflationary 
 trend if agents know their income before bidding.
  
 We also consider a model with an active central bank, which is both 
 accurately informed and flexible in its ability to change interest 
 rates. This, however, may not be sufficient to control inflation.

Title: Fully Nonparametric Estimation of Scalar Diffusion Models 
Abstract: We propose a functional estimation procedure for homogeneous 
 stochastic differential equations based on a discrete sample of 
 observations and with minimal requirements on the data generating 
 process. We show how to identify the drift and diffusion function in 
 situations where one or the other function is considered a nuisance 
 parameter. The asymptotic behavior of the estimators is examined as 
 the observation frequency increases and as the time span lengthens 
 (that is, we implement both infill and long span asymptotics). We 
 prove consistency and convergence to mixtures of normal laws, where 
 the mixing variates depend on the chronological local time of the 
 underlying process, that is the time spent by the process in the 
 vicinity of a spatial point. The estimation method and asymptotic 
 results apply to both stationary and nonstationary processes.

Title: Nonlinear Instrumental Variable Estimation of an 
 Autoregression 
Abstract: Instrumental variable (IV) estimation methods that allow for 
 certain nonlinear functions of the data as instruments are studied. 
 The context of the discussion is the simple unit root model where 
 certain advantages to the use of nonlinear instruments are revealed. 
 In particular, certain classes of IV estimators and associated t-tests 
 are shown to have simpler (standard) limit theory in contrast to the 
 least squares estimator, providing an opportunity for the study of 
 optimal estimation in certain IV classes and furnishing tests and 
 confidence intervals that allow for unit root and stationary 
 alternatives. The Cauchy estimator studied in recent work by So and 
 Shin (1999) is shown to have such an optimality property in the class 
 of certain IV procedures with bounded instruments.

Title: Bootstrapping Spurious Regression 
Abstract: The bootstrap is shown to be inconsistent in spurious 
 regression. The failure of the bootstrap is spectacular in that the 
 bootstrap effectively turns a spurious regression into a cointegrating 
 regression. In particular, the serial correlation coefficient of the 
 residuals in the bootstrap regression does not converge to unity, so 
 the bootstrap is not even first order consistent. The block bootstrap 
 serial correlation coefficient does converge to unity and is therefore 
 first order consistent, but has a slower rate of convergence and a 
 different limit distribution from that of the sample data serial 
 correlation coefficient. The analysis covers spurious regressions 
 involving both deterministic trends and stochastic trends. The results 
 reinforce earlier warnings about routine use of the bootstrap with 
 dependent data.

Title: A CUSUM Test for Cointegration Using Regression Residuals 
Abstract: We show that the conventional CUSUM test for structural 
 change can be applied to cointegrating regression residuals leading to 
 a consistent residual based test for the null hypothesis of 
 cointegration. The proposed tests are semiparametric and utilize fully 
 modified residuals to correct for endogeneity and serial correlation 
 and to scale out nuisance parameters. The limit distribution of the 
 test is derived under both the null and the alternative hypothesis. 
 The tests are easy to use and are found to perform quite well in a 
 Monte Carlo experiment.

Title: Egalitarianism against the Veil of Ignorance 
Abstract: J. Rawls and R. Dworkin have each used veils of ignorance to 
 justify equality (Rawls) or to compute what equality entails
 (Dworkin). J. Harsanyi has also derived a distributive ethic from a 
 veil of ignorance argument, which, although not egalitarian, is 
 believed by Harsanyi to be not excessively inegalitarian. 
  
 Harsanyi's analysis does not determine a unique social choice 
 function, but rather a family of such functions. Here, by appending 
 more information to Harsanyi's environment, and an Axiom of 
 Neutrality, I uniquely determine a social welfare function by 
 extending Harsanyi's argument. I show that this function is strongly 
 inegalitarian, in that it recommends resource transfers from disabled 
 to able individuals. 
  
 Some concluding remarks are offered against using the veil of 
 ignorance in studying the distributive ethics.

Title: Value and Politics 
Abstract: A brief, historical review of the study of the 
 interdependency between politics and economic distribution is offered. 
 While the impact of economic interests on politics has been 
 acknowledged for thousands of years, and the impact of politics on 
 distribution for hundreds, it is only in the last thirty years that 
 formal models of the interdependency between economic distribution and 
 politics have been formulated. A general model of political-economic 
 equilibrium is proposed, in which political competition and economic 
 distribution jointly determine each other. Several examples are given. 
 The author proposes that political economy, conceived of as studying 
 this process of joint determination, is in its infancy.

Title: What We Owe Our Children, They Their Children,... 
Abstract: Egalitarian theorists, since Rawls, have in the main 
 advocated equalizing some objective measure of individual well-being, 
 such as primary goods, functioning, or resources, rather than 
 subjective welfare. This discussion, however, has assumed, implicitly, 
 a static environment. By analyzing a society that survives for many 
 generations, we demonstrate that equality of opportunity for some 
 objective condition is incompatible with human development over time. 
 We argue that this incompatibility can be resolved by equalizing 
 opportunities for welfare. Thus, 'subjectivism' seems necessary if we 
 are to hope for a society which can both equalize opportunities and 
 support the development of human capacity over time.

Title: The Equity Premium Consensus Forecast Revisited 
Abstract: A seller wishes to sell an object to one of multiple bidders. 
 The valuations of the bidders are privately known. We consider the 
 joint design problem in which the seller can decide the accuracy by 
 which bidders learn their valuation and to whom to sell at what price. 
 We establish that optimal information structures in an optimal auction 
 exhibit a number of properties: (i) information structures can be
 represented by monotone partitions, (ii) the cardinality of each 
 partition is finite, (iii) the partitions are asymmetric across 
 agents. These properties imply that the optimal selling strategy of a 
 seller can be implemented by a sequence of exclusive take-it or 
 leave-it offers.

Title: The Progress of Computing 
Abstract: The present study analyzes computer performance over the last 
 century and a half. Three results stand out. First, there has been a 
 phenomenal increase in computer power over the twentieth century. 
 Performance in constant dollars or in terms of labor units has 
 improved since 1900 by a factor in the order of 1 trillion to 5 
 trillion, which represent compound growth rates of over 30 percent 
 per year for a century. Second, there were relatively small 
 improvements in efficiency (perhaps a factor of ten) in the century 
 before World War II. Around World War II, however, there was a 
 substantial acceleration in productivity, and the growth in computer 
 power from 1940 to 2001 has averaged 55 percent per year. Third, this 
 study develops estimates of the growth in computer power relying on 
 performance rather than on input-based measures typically used by 
 official statistical agencies. The price declines using 
 performance-based measures are markedly higher than those reported in 
 the official statistics.

Title: Compromises Between Cardinality and Ordinality in Preference 
 Theory and Social Choice 
Abstract: By taking sets of utility functions as a primitive 
 description of agents, we define an ordering over assumptions on 
 utility functions that gauges their implicit measurement requirements. 
 Cardinal and ordinal assumptions constitute two types of measurement 
 requirements, but several standard assumptions in economics lie 
 between these extremes. We first apply the ordering to different 
 theories for why consumer preferences should be convex and show that 
 diminishing marginal utility, which for complete preferences implies 
 convexity, is an example of a compromise between cardinality and 
 ordinality. In contrast, the Arrow-Koopmans theory of convexity, 
 although proposed as an ordinal theory, relies on utility functions 
 that lie in the cardinal measurement class. In a second application, 
 we show that diminishing marginal utility, rather than the standard 
 stronger assumption of cardinality, also justifies utilitarian 
 recommendations on redistribution and axiomatizes the Pigou-Dalton 
 principle. We also show that transitivity and order-density (but not 
 completeness) characterize the ordinal preferences that can be induced 
 from sets of utility functions, present a general cardinality theorem 
 for additively separable preferences, and provide sufficient 
 conditions for orderings of assumptions on utility functions to be 
 acyclic and transitive.

Title: Exchange Rates and Casualties During the First World War 
Abstract: I estimate a single factor model of Swiss exchange rates 
 during World War I for five of the primary belligerents: Britain, 
 France, Italy, Germany, and Austria-Hungary. At the outbreak of the 
 war these nations suspended convertibility of their currencies into 
 gold with the promise that after the war each would restore 
 convertibility at the old par. However, once convertibility was 
 suspended, each currency became a state-contingent claim; after the 
 war it would pay off at (or near) the old par if the country won or 
 pay off significantly less than par (perhaps nothing) if the country 
 lost. The single factor extracted from the five exchange rates appears 
 to contain information on contemporaries' expectations about the war's 
 outcome. Innovations to the single factor are correlated with time 
 series on soldiers killed and wounded and soldiers taken prisoner.

Title: Accessible Pareto-Improvements: Using Market 
 Information to Reform Inefficiencies 
Abstract: We study Pareto improvements whose implementation requires 
 knowledge of only market prices and traded quantities, not utility and 
 demand functions. Quantity stabilization gives agents the right to 
 repeat the net trades they previously conducted, but requires 
 policymakers to have records of those trades. While reasonable in some 
 partial equilibrium contexts, such an assumption is implausible in 
 general equilibrium. To diminish informational requirements further, 
 we also consider price stabilization, which holds constant the 
 relative prices that consumers face. Although price stabilizations do 
 not achieve first-best efficiency, they lead to Pareto-improvements 
 and production efficiency. Moreover, the production efficiency 
 advantage persists under price stabilization but not under quantity 
 stabilization when some firms are not profit-maximizers; this 
 difference can be critical in transition policies for planned 
 economies. In addition to planning, we consider several other 
 applications of quantity and price stabilization, both partial 
 equilibrium and general equilibrium: removal of rent controls, 
 deregulation of a cross-subsidizing public utility, and the entry of 
 an autarkic economy into world trade.

Title: If You're So Smart, Why Aren't You Rich? Belief 
 Selection in Complete and Incomplete Markets 
Abstract: This paper provides an analysis of the asymptotic properties 
 of consumption allocations in a stochastic general equilibrium model 
 with heterogeneous consumers. In particular we investigate the market 
 selection hypothesis, that markets favor traders with more accurate 
 beliefs. We show that in any Pareto optimal allocation whether each 
 consumer vanishes or survives is determined entirely by discount 
 factors and beliefs. Since equilibrium allocations in economies with 
 complete markets are Pareto optimal, our results characterize the 
 limit behavior of these economies. We show that, all else equal, the 
 market selects for consumers who use Bayesian learning with the truth 
 in the support of their prior and selects among Bayesians according to 
 the size of the their parameter space. Finally, we show that in 
 economies with incomplete markets these conclusions may not hold. 
 Payoff functions can matter for long run survival, and the market 
 selection hypothesis fails.

Title: Perfectly Fair Allocations with Indivisibilities 
Abstract: One set of n objects of type I, another set of n objects of 
 type II, and an amount M of money is to be completely allocated among 
 n agents in such a way that each agent gets one object of each type 
 with some amount of money. We propose a new solution concept to this 
 problem called a perfectly fair allocation. It is a refinement of the 
 concept of fair allocation. An appealing and interesting property of 
 this concept is that every perfectly fair allocation is Pareto 
 optimal. It is also shown that a perfectly fair allocation is envy 
 free and gives each agent what he likes best, and that a fair 
 allocation need not be perfectly fair. Furthermore, we give a 
 necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a perfectly 
 fair allocation. Precisely, we show that there exists a perfectly fair 
 allocation if and only if the valuation matrix is an optimality 
 preserved matrix. Optimality preserved matrices are a class of new and 
 interesting matrices. An extension of the model is also discussed.

Title: A Practical Competitive Market Model for Indivisible Commo 
Abstract: A general and practical competitive market model for trading 
 indivisible goods is introduced. There are a group of buyers and a 
 group of sellers, and several indivisible goods. Each buyer is 
 initially endowed with a sufficient amount of money and each seller is 
 endowed with several units of each indivisible good. Each buyer has 
 reservation values over bundles of indivisible goods above which he 
 will not buy and each seller has reservation values over bundles of 
 his own indivisible goods below which he will not sell. Buyers and 
 sellers' preferences depend on the bundle of indivisible goods and the 
 quantity of money they consume. All preferences are assumed to be 
 quasi-linear in money and money is treated as a perfectly divisible 
 good. It is shown in an extremely simple manner that the market has a 
 Walrasian equilibrium if and only if an associated linear program 
 problem has an optimal solution with its value equal to the potential 
 market value. In addition, it is shown that the equilibrium prices of 
 the goods and the profits of the agents are the optimal solutions of 
 the linear program problem.

Title: Liquidity, Default and Crashes: Endogenous Contracts in General 
 Equilibrium 
Abstract: Introducing default and limited collateral into general 
 equilibrium theory (GE) allows for a theory of endogenous contracts, 
 including endogenous margin requirements on loans. This in turn allows 
 GE to explain liquidity and liquidity crises in equilibrium. A formal 
 definition of liquidity is presented. 
  
 When new information raises the probability a fixed income asset may 
 default, its drop in price may be much greater than its objective drop 
 in value because the drop in value reduces the relative wealth of its 
 natural buyers, who disproportiantely own the asset through leveraged 
 purchases. When the information also shortens the horizon over which 
 the asset might default, its price falls still further because the 
 margin requirement for its purchase endogenously rises. There may be 
 spillovers in which other assets also crash in price even though their 
 probability of default did not change.

Title: Liquidity, Default and Crashes: Endogenous Contracts in General 
 Equilibrium 
Abstract: The possibility of default limits available liquidity. If the 
 potential default draws nearer, a liquidity crisis may ensue, causing 
 a crash in asset prices, even if the probability of default barely 
 changes, and even if no defaults subsequently materialize. Introducing 
 default and limited collateral into general equilibrium theory (GE) 
 allows for a theory of endogenous contracts, including endogenous 
 margin requirements on loans. This in turn allows GE to explain 
 liquidity and liquidity crises in equilibrium. A formal definition of 
 liquidity is presented.
  
 When new information raises the probability and shortens the horizon 
 over which a fixed income asset may default, its drop in price may be 
 much greater than its objective drop in value for two reasons: the 
 drop in value reduces the relative wealth of its natural buyers and 
 also endogenously raises the margin required for its purchase. The 
 liquidity premium rises, and there may be spillovers in which other 
 assets crash in price even though their probability of default did not 
 change.

Title: Insurance Contracts Designed by Competitive Pooling 
Abstract: We build a model of competitive pooling and show how 
 insurance contracts emerge in equilibrium, designed by the invisible 
 hand of perfect competition. When pools are exclusive, we obtain a 
 unique separating equilibrium. When pools are not exclusive but 
 seniority is recognized, we obtain a different unique equilibrium: the 
 pivotal  primary-secondary equilibrium. Here reliable and unreliable 
 households take out a common primary insurance up to its maximum 
 limit, and then unreliable households take out further secondary 
 insurance.

Title: Social Security Investment in Equities 
Abstract: This paper explores the general equilibrium impact of 
 social security portfolio diversification into private securities, 
 either through the trust fund or private accounts. The analysis 
 depends critically on heterogeneities in saving, production, assets, 
 and taxes. Limited diversification weakly increases interest rates, 
 reduces the expected return on short-term investment (and the equity 
 premium), decreases safe investment, increases risky investment and
 increases a suitably weighted social welfare function. However, the 
 effects on aggregate investment, long-term capital values, and the 
 utility of young savers hinges on assumptions about technology. 
 Aggregate investment and long-term asset values can move in opposite 
 directions.

Title: International Finance in General Equilibrium 
Abstract: Our purpose in this paper is to unify international trade 
 and finance in a single general equilibrium model. Our model is rich 
 enough to include multiple commodities (including traded and nontraded 
 goods), heterogeneous consumers in each country, multiple time 
 periods, multiple credit markets, and multiple currencies. Yet our 
 model is simple enough to be effectively computable. We explicitly 
 calculate the financial and real effects of changes in tariffs, 
 productivity, and preferences, as well as the effects of monetary and 
 fiscal policy. 
  
 We maintain agent optimization, rational expectations, and market 
 clearing (i.e., perfect competition with flexible prices) throughout. 
 But because of the important role money plays, and because of the 
 heterogeneity of markets and agents, we find that fiscal and monetary 
 policy both have real effects. The effects of policy on real income, 
 long-term interest rates, and exchange rates are qualitatively 
 identical to those suggested in Mundell-Fleming (without the small 
 country hypothesis), although our equilibrating mechanisms are 
 different. However, because the Mundell-Fleming model ignores 
 expectations and relative price changes, our model predicts different 
 effects on the flow of capital, the balance of trade, and real 
 exchange rates in some circumstances.

Title: The CNBC Effect: Welfare Effects of Public Information 
Abstract: What are the welfare effects of enhanced 
 dissemination of public information through the media and disclosures 
 by market participants with high public visibility? For instance, is 
 it always desirable to have frequent and timely publications of 
 economic statistics by government agencies and the central bank? We 
 examine the impact of public information in a setting where agents 
 take actions appropriate to the underlying fundamentals, but they also 
 have a coordination motive arising from a strategic complementarity in 
 their actions. When the agents have no private information, greater 
 provision of public information always increases welfare. However, 
 when agents also have access to independent sources of information, 
 the welfare effect of increased public disclosures is ambiguous.

Title: Nonparametric Estimation of a Multifactor Heath-Jarrow-Morton 
 Model: An Integrated Approach 
Abstract: We develop a nonparametric estimator for the volatility 
 structure of the zero coupon yield curve in the Heath-Jarrow-Morton 
 framework. The estimator incorporates cross-sectional restrictions 
 along the maturity dimension, and also allows for measurement 
 errors, which arise from the estimation of the yield curve from 
 noisy data. The estimates are implemented with daily CRSP bond data.

Title: Regression with Slowly Varying Regressors 
Abstract: Slowly varying regressors are asymptotically collinear 
 in linear regression. Usual regression formulae for asymptotic 
 standard errors remain valid but rates of convergence are affected 
 and the limit distribution of the regression coefficients is shown to 
 be one dimensional. Some asymptotic representations of partial sums of 
 slowly varying functions and central limit theorems with slowly 
 varying weights are given that assist in the development of a 
 regression theory. Multivariate regression and polynomial regression 
 with slowly varying functions are considered and shown to be 
 equivalent, up to standardization, to regression on a polynomial in a 
 logarithmic trend. The theory involves second, third and higher order 
 forms of slow variation. Some applications to trend regression are 
 discussed.

Title: Gaussian Estimation of Continuous Time Models of the Short Term 
 Interest Rate 
Abstract: This paper proposes a Gaussian estimator for nonlinear 
 continuous time models of the short term interest rate. The approach 
 is based on a stopping time argument that produces a normalizing 
 transformation facilitating the use of a Gaussian likelihood. A Monte 
 Carlo study shows that the finite sample performance of the proposed 
 procedure offers an improvement over the discrete approximation method 
 proposed by Nowman (1997). An empirical application to U.S. and 
 British interest rates is given.

Title: Second Order Expansions for the Distribution of the Maximum 
 Likelihood Estimator of the Fractional Difference Parameter 
Abstract: The maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of the fractional 
 difference parameter in the Gaussian ARFIMA(0,d,0) model is well 
 known to be asymptotically N(0,6/pi2). This paper develops a second 
 order asymptotic expansion to the distribution of this statistic. 
 The correction term for the density is shown to be independent of 
 d, so that the MLE is second order pivotal for d. This feature of 
 the MLE is unusual, at least in time series contexts. Simulations 
 show that the normal approximation is poor and that the expansions 
 make significant improvements in accuracy.

Title: On the Evolution of Overconfidence and Entrepreneurs 
Abstract: This paper explains why seemingly irrational overconfident 
 behavior can persist. Information aggregation is poor in groups 
 in which most individuals herd. By ignoring the herd, the actions 
 of overconfident individuals ("entrepreneurs") convey their private 
 information. However, entrepreneurs make mistakes and thus die more 
 frequently. The socially optimal proportion of entrepreneurs trades 
 off the positive information externality against high attrition rates 
 of entrepreneurs, and depends on the size of the group, on the degree 
 of overconfidence, and on the accuracy of individuals' private 
 information. The stationary distribution trades off the fitness of the 
 group against the fitness of overconfident individuals.

Title: An Economic Approach to the Psychology of Change: Amnesia, 
 Inertia, and Impulsiveness 
Abstract: This paper models how imperfect memory affects the optimal 
 continuity of policies. We examine the choices of a player (individual 
 or firm) who observes previous actions but cannot remember the 
 rationale for these actions. In a stable environment, the player 
 optimally responds to memory loss with excess inertia, defined as a 
 higher probability of following old policies than would occur under 
 full recall. In a volatile environment, the player can exhibit excess 
 impulsiveness (i.e., be more prone to follow new information signals). 
 The model provides a memory-loss explanation for some documented 
 psychological biases, implies that inertia and organizational routines 
 should be more important in stable environments than in volatile ones, 
 and provides other empirical implications relating memory and 
 environmental variables to the continuity of decisions.

Title: Signalling and Default: Rothschild-Stiglitz Reconsidered 
Abstract: In our previous paper we built a general equilibrium model of 
 default and punishment in which equilibrium always exists and 
 endogenously determines asset promises, penalties, and sales 
 constraints. In this paper we interpret the endogenous sales 
 constraints as equilibrium signals. By specializing the default 
 penalties and imposing an exclusivity constraint on asset sales, we 
 obtain a perfectly competitive version of the Rothschild-Stiglitz 
 model of insurance. In our model their separating equilibrium always 
 exists even when they say it doesn't.

Title: Default and Punishment in General Equilibrium
Abstract: We extend the standard model of general equilibrium with
 incomplete markets to allow for default and punishment by thinking
 of assets as pools. The equilibrating variables include expected
 delivery rates, along with the usual prices of assets and commodities.
 By reinterpreting the variables, our model encompasses a broad range
 of adverse selection and signalling phenomena in a perfectly
 competitive, general equilibrium framework.
 
 Perfect competition eliminates the need for lenders to compute how
 the size of their loan or the price they quote might affect default
 rates. It also makes for a simple equilibrium refinement, which we
 propose in order to rule out irrational pessimism about deliveries
 of untraded assets.
 
 We show that refined equilibrium always exists in our model, and
 that default, in conjunction with refinement, opens the door to a
 theory of endogenous assets. The market chooses the promises,
 default penalties, and quantity constraints of actively traded
 assets.

Abstract: We extend the standard model of general equilibrium with 
 incomplete markets to allow for default and punishment. The 
 equilibrating variables include expected delivery rates, along with 
 the usual prices of assets and commodities. By reinterpreting the 
 variables, our model encompasses a broad range of moral hazard, 
 adverse selection, and signalling phenomena (including the Akerlof 
 lemons model and Rothschild-Stiglitz insurance model) in a general 
 equilibrium framework. 
  
 We impose a condition on the expected delivery rates for untraded 
 assets that is similar to the trembling hand refinements used in 
 game theory. Despite earlier claims about the nonexistence of 
 equilibrium with adverse selection, we show that equilibrium always 
 exists, even with exclusivity constraints on asset sales, and 
 transactions-liquidity costs or information-evaluation costs for asset 
 trade. 
  
 We show that more lenient punishment which encourages default may be 
 Pareto improving because it allows for better risk spreading. 
  
 We also show that default opens the door to a theory of endogenous 
 assets.

Title: Entry and Vertical Differentiation 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the entry of new products into
 vertically differentiated markets where an entrant and an incumbent 
 compete in quantities. The value of the new product is initially 
 uncertain and new information is generated through purchases in the 
 market. We derive the (unique) Markov perfect equilibrium of the 
 infinite horizon game under the strong long run average payoff 
 criterion. 
  
 The qualitative features of the optimal entry strategy are shown to 
 depend exclusively on the relative ranking of established and new 
 products based on current beliefs. Superior products are launched 
 relatively slowly and at high initial prices whereas substitutes for 
 existing products are launched aggressively at low initial prices. 
  
 The robustness of these results with respect to different model 
 specifications is discussed.

Title: Fiscal Policy: Its Macroeconomics in Perspective 
Abstract: President George W. Bush is preparing a drastic permanent 
 reduction in federal income and estate taxes. He cites as precedents 
 tax cuts by Kennedy-Johnson 1962-64 and Reagan 1981. In those cases, 
 however, the economy was operating well below full employment and 
 needed a "demand-side" stimulus (even though Reagan advertised his tax 
 reduction as "supply-side"). In 2001, however, the economy is very 
 close to full employment, and if it needs a stimulus at all, it is a 
 quick modest temporary one instead of the large permanent one 
 proposed. And why can't monetary policy do the job of stabilization, 
 as it did successfully in the 1990s? A policy mix that assigns short 
 run demand stabilization to the central bank is for several reasons 
 preferable to a tight-money-easy-fiscal mix. In the case of Reagan and 
 Bush the younger, federal tax cuts are advocated on philosophical and 
 ideological grounds, diminution of the size and scope of government. 
 But formulation of the issue as government versus people is a 
 misunderstanding of democracy and of the reciprocities between public 
 and private sectors.

Title: On Modeling the Effects of Inflation Shocks
Abstract: A popular model in the literature postulates an interest rate rule,
 a NAIRU price equation, and an aggregate demand equation in which aggregate
 demand depends on the real interest rate. In this model a positive inflation
 shock with the nominal interest rate held constant is explosive because it
 increases aggregate demand (because the real interest rate is lower), which
 increases inflation through the price equation, which further increases
 aggregate demand, and so on. In order for the model to be stable, the nominal
 interest rate must rise more than inflation, which means that the coefficient
 on inflation in the interest rate rule must be greater than one.
 
 The results in this paper suggest, however, that an inflation shock with the
 nominal interest rate held constant has a negative effect on real output.
 There are three reasons. First, the data support the use of nominal rather
 than real interest rates in aggregate expenditure equations. Second, the
 evidence suggests that the percentage increase in nominal household wealth
 from a positive inflation shock is less than the percentage increase in the
 price level, which is contractionary because of the fall in real wealth.
 Third, there is evidence that wages lag prices, and so a positive inflation
 shock results in an initial fall in real wage rates and thus real labor
 income, which is contractionary. If these three features are true, they imply
 that a positive inflation shock has a negative effect on aggregate demand
 even if the nominal interest rate is held constant. Not only does the Fed not
 have to increase the nominal interest rate more than the increase in inflation
 for there to be a contraction, it does not have to increase the nominal rate
 at all!

Abstract: What determines how trade in a commodity is divided between 
 privately negotiated transactions via "middle men" (dealer/brokers) 
 in a telephone or "dealer market" versus transactions via "market 
 makers" (specialists) at publicly observable bid/ask prices? To 
 address this question, we extend Spulber's (1996a) search model 
 with buyers, sellers, and price setting dealers to include a fourth 
 type of agent, market makers. The result is a model where market 
 microstructure -- the division of trade between dealers and market 
 makers -- is determined endogenously. In Spulber's model, dealers 
 are the exclusive avenue of exchange, and prices are private in the 
 sense that price quotes can only be obtained through direct contact 
 (e.g. telephone calls) to individual dealers. In contrast a market 
 maker can be conceptualized as operating an exchange that posts 
 publicly observable bid and ask prices. In our model buyers and 
 sellers can either trade with the market maker at the publicly posted 
 bid/ask price or they can search for a better price in the dealer 
 market. We show that the entry of a monopolist market maker can be 
 profitable if it has a lower marginal cost of processing transactions 
 than the least efficient middle man in the equilibrium without market
 makers. If this is the case the entry of a market maker segments the 
 market; the highest valuation buyers and the lowest cost sellers 
 trade with the market maker and the residual set of intermediate 
 valuation buyers and sellers search for better prices in the dealer 
 market. Dealers act as a "competitive fringe" that undercut the 
 bid/ask spread charged by the monopolist market maker. However less 
 efficient dealers are driven out of business. The remaining dealers 
 are still profitable although the entry of a monopolist market 
 maker significantly reduces their profits and  bid-ask spreads. 
 Thus, entry by a marker maker results in uniformly higher surpluses 
 for buyers and sellers and higher trading volumes. When there is free 
 entry into market making and market makers' marginal costs of 
 processing transactions tend to zero, bid-ask spreads converge to 
 zero and a fully efficient Walrasian equilibrium outcome emerges.

Title: Estimates of the Effectiveness of Monetary Policy 
Abstract: This paper examines various interest rate rules, as well as
 policies derived by solving optimal control problems, for their ability
 to dampen economic fluctuations caused by random shocks. A tax rate rule
 is also considered. A multicountry econometric model is used for the
 experiments. The results differ sharply from those obtained using recent
 models in which the coefficient on inflation in the nominal interest rate
 rule must be greater than one in order for the economy to be stable.

Title: Monotone Preferences over Information 
Abstract: We consider preference relations over information that are 
 monotone: more information is preferred to less. We prove that, if 
 a preference relation on information about an uncountable set of 
 states of nature is monotone, then it is not representable by a 
 utility function.

Title: Measurability Is Not about Information 
Abstract: We comment on the relation between models of information 
 based on signals/partitions, and those based on sigma-algebras. We 
 show that more informative signals need not generate finer 
 sigma-algebras, hence that Blackwell's theorem fails if information 
 is modeled as sigma-algebras. The reason is that the sigma-algebra 
 generated by a partition does not contain all the events that can be 
 known from the information provided by the signal. We also show that 
 there is a non-conventional sigma-algebra that can be associated to 
 a signal which does preserve its information content. Further, 
 expectations and conditional expectations may depend on the choice 
 of sigma-algebra that is associated to a signal. We provide a simple 
 characterization of when the model is robust to changes in the 
 sigma-algebras.

Title: Valuation Ratios and the Long-run Stock Market Outlook: 
 An Update 
Abstract: The use of price-earnings ratios and dividend-price ratios 
 as forecasting variables for the stock market is examined using 
 aggregate annual US data 1871 to 2000 and aggregate quarterly data 
 for twelve countries since 1970. Various simple efficient-markets 
 models of financial markets imply that these ratios should be useful 
 in forecasting future dividend growth, future earnings growth, or 
 future productivity growth. We conclude that, overall, the ratios do 
 poorly in forecasting any of these. Rather, the ratios appear to be 
 useful primarily in forecasting future stock price changes, contrary 
 to the simple efficient-markets models. This paper is an update of our 
 earlier paper (1998), to take account of the remarkable behavior of 
 the stock market in the closing years of the twentieth century.

Title: Expected Utility Theory without the Completeness Axiom 
Abstract: We study axiomatically the problem of obtaining an expected 
 utility representation for a potentially incomplete preference 
 relation over lotteries by means of a set of von Neumann-Morgenstern 
 utility functions. It is shown that, when the prize space is a 
 compact metric space, a preference relation admits such a 
 multi-utility representation provided that it satisfies the standard 
 axioms of expected utility theory. Moreover, the representing set 
 of utilities is unique in a well-defined sense.

Title: Local Polynomial Whittle Estimation of Long-range Dependence 
Abstract: The local Whittle (or Gaussian semiparametric) estimator of 
 long range dependence, proposed by Kunsch (1987) and analyzed by 
 Robinson (1995a), has a relatively slow rate of convergence and a 
 finite sample bias that can be large. In this paper, we generalize 
 the local Whittle estimator to circumvent those problems. Instead 
 of approximating the short-run component of the spectrum, phi(lambda), 
 by a constant in a shrinking neighborhood of frequency zero, we 
 approximate its logarithm by a polynomial. This leads to a "local 
 polynomial Whittle" (LPW) estimator. 
  
 Following the work of Robinson (1995a), we establish the asymptotic 
 bias, variance, mean-squared error (MSE), and normality of the LPW 
 estimator. We determine the asymptotically MSE-optimal bandwidth, and 
 specify a plug-in selection method for its practical implementation. 
 When phi(lambda) is smooth enough near the origin, we find that the 
 bias of the LPW estimator goes to zero at a faster rate than that of 
 the local Whittle estimator, and its variance is only inflated by a 
 multiplicative constant. In consequence, the rate of convergence of 
 the LPW estimator is faster than that of the local Whittle estimator, 
 given an appropriate choice of the bandwidth m. 
  
 We show that the LPW estimator attains the optimal rate of convergence 
 for a class of spectra containing those for which varphi(lambda) is 
 smooth of order s > 1 near zero. When phi(lambda) is infinitely smooth 
 near zero, the rate of convergence of the LPW estimator based on a 
 polynomial of high degree is arbitrarily close to n^{-1/2}.

Title: The Financing of Innovation: Learning and Stopping 
Abstract: This paper considers the financing of a research project
 under uncertainty about the time of completion and the probability
 of eventual success. We distinguish between two financing modes,
 namely relationship financing, where the allocation decision of
 the entrepreneur is observable, and arm's length financing, where
 it is unobservable.

 We find that equilibrium funding stops altogether too early relative
 to the efficient stopping time in both financing modes. The rate at
 which funding is released becomes tighter over time under relationship
 financing, and looser under arm's length financing. The trade-off in
 the choice of financing modes is between lack of commitment with
 relationship financing and information rents with arm's length
 financing.

Title: The Financing of Innovation: Learning and Stopping 
Abstract: This paper considers the financing of a research project 
 under uncertainty about the time of completion and the probability 
 of eventual success. The uncertainty about future success gradually 
 diminishes with the arrival of addtional funding. The entrepreneur 
 controls the funds and can divert them. We distinguish between 
 relationship financing, meaning that the entrepreneur's allocation 
 of the funds is observable, and arm's length financing, where it is 
 unobservable. 
  
 We find that equilibrium funding stops altogether too early relative 
 to the efficient stopping time in both financing modes. We 
 characterize the optimal contracts and equilibrium funding decisions. 
 The financial constraints will typically become tighter over time 
 under relationship finance, and looser under arm's length financing. 
 The trade-off is that while relationship financing may require smaller 
 information rents, arm's length financing amounts to an implicit 
 commitment to a finite funding horizon. The lack of such a commitment 
 under relationship financing implies that the sustainable release of 
 funds eventually slows down. We obtain the surprising result that 
 arm's length contracts are preferable in a Pareto sense.

Title: Electoral Rules and the Emergence of New Issue Dimensions 
Abstract: Different electoral rules provide different incentives for 
 parties competing for votes to adopt emerging issues. As a result, 
 new societal issues will be integrated at different speeds into the 
 political arena, and ultimately, into policy. In order to study this 
 question formally, I propose an extension of the standard spatial 
 model of political competition that allows for issue adoption and 
 more generally, issue prioritizing at the platform level. The paper 
 then compares the outcome of party competition under proportional and 
 plurality rule. Entry is allowed and incumbent parties act as 
 Stackelberg leaders vis-a-vis potential entrants. The analysis 
 highlights the interaction between entry barriers and the type of 
 emerging issue in determining when and how a new issue will be 
 introduced. The theory explains both internal (that is, without 
 entry by a new party) realignments of party systems along new 
 dimensions and entry as part of the process of political realignment.

Title: A Computational Analysis of the Core of a Trading Economy with 
 Three Competitive Equilibria and a Finite Number of Traders 
Abstract: In this paper we examine the structure of the core of a 
 trading economy with three competitive equilibria as the number of 
 traders (N) is varied. We also examine the sensitivity of the 
 multiplicity of equilibria and of the core to variations in individual 
 initial endowments. Computational results show that the core first 
 splits into two pieces at N = 5 and then splits a second time into 
 three pieces at N = 12. Both of these splits occur not at a point but 
 as a contiguous gap. As N is increased further, the core shrinks by 
 N = 600 with essentially only the 3 competitive equilibria remaining. 
 We find that the speed of convergence of the core toward the three 
 competitive equilibria is not uniform. Initially, for small N, it is 
 not of the order 1/N but when N is large, the convergence rate is 
 approximately of the order 1/N. Small variations in the initial 
 individual endowments along the price rays to the competitive 
 equilibria make the respective competitive equilibrium (CE) unique and 
 once a CE becomes unique, it remains so for all allocations on the 
 price ray. Sensitivity analysis of the core reveals that in the large 
 part of the endowment space where the competitive equilibrium is 
 unique, the core either converges to the single CE or it splits into 
 two segments, one of which converges to the CE and the other 
 disappears.

Title: Multifractal Products of Cylindrical Rules 
Abstract: A new class of random multiplicative and statistically 
 self-similar measures is defned on IR. It is the limit of 
 measure-valued martingales constructed by multiplying random 
 functions attached to the points of a statistically self-similar 
 Poisson point process in a strip of the plane. Several fundamental 
 problems are solved, including the non-degeneracy and the 
 distribution of the limit measure, mu; the finiteness of the 
 (positive and negative) moments of the total mass of mu restricted 
 to bounded intervals. 
  
 Compared to the familiar canonical multifractals generated by 
 multiplicative cascades, the new measures and their multifractal 
 analysis exhibit strikingly novel features which are discussed in 
 detail.

Title: New Data and Output Concepts for Understanding Productivity 
 Trends 
Abstract: The present study is the second is a series of three papers 
 devoted to issues in the measurement of productivity and productivity 
 growth. The contributions of the present paper are three. First, it 
 introduces a new approach to measuring industrial productivity based 
 on income-side data that are published by the Bureau of Economic 
 Analysis (BEA). The data are internally consistent in that both inputs 
 and outputs are income-side measures of value added, whereas the usual 
 productivity measures combine expenditure-side output measures with 
 income-side input measures. Second, because of interest in the "new 
 economy," we have also constructed a set of new- economy accounts. For 
 the purpose of this study, we define the new economy as machinery, 
 electric equipment, telephone and telegraph, and software. Finally, 
 because of concerns about poor deflation in the current output 
 measures, this study constructs a new output concept called 
 "well-measured output," which includes only those sectors for which 
 output is relatively well measured. We present a brief summary of the 
 behavior of the alternative measures.

Title: A Graphical Analysis of Some Basic Results in Social Choice 
Abstract: We use a simple graphical approach to represent Social 
 Welfare Functions that satisfy Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives 
 and Anonymity. This approach allows us to provide simple and 
 illustrative proofs of May's Theorem, of variants of classic

Title: Productivity Growth and the New Economy 
Abstract: The present study is the third in a series of three papers 
 devoted to issues in the measurement of productivity and productivity 
 growth. The major findings are as follows. First, this study shows 
 that the new data set used here, which develops data on total output, 
 business sector output, and "well-measured" output, and relying on 
 income-side data, provides a useful supplement to existing data sets. 
 Second, there has clearly been a rebound in labor-productivity growth 
 in recent years. All three sectoral definitions show a major 
 acceleration in labor productivity in the last three years of the 
 period (1996-98) relative to the 1978-95 period. The rebound was 1.2 
 percentage points for GDP, 1.8 percentage points for business sector, 
 and 2.1 percentage points for well-measured output. Third, 
 productivity growth in the new economy sectors has made a significant 
 contribution to economy-wide productivity growth. For the business 
 sector, of the 1.82 percentage point increase in labor-productivity 
 growth in the last three years, 0.65 percentage point was due to the 
 new-economy sectors. Finally, for all three output measures, there has 
 been a substantial upturn in labor-productivity growth outside the new 
 economy. After removing the direct effect of new economy sectors, the 
 productivity acceleration was 0.54 percentage points for total GDP, 
 0.65 percentage points for business output, and 1.18 percentage points 
 for well- measured output. It is clear that the productivity rebound 
 is not narrowly focused in a few new-economy sectors.

Title: Structural Change in Tail Behavior and the Asian Financial 
 Crisis 
Abstract: This paper explores tests of the hypothesis that the tail 
 thickness of a distribution is constant over time. Using Hill's 
 conditional maximum likelihood estimator for the tail index of a 
 distribution, tests of tail shape constancy are constructed that 
 allow for an unknown breakpoint. The recursive test is shown to be 
 inconsistent in one direction, and only a one-sided test is 
 recommended. Specifically, the test can be used when the alternative 
 hypothesis is that the tail index decreases over time. A rolling and 
 sequential version of the test is consistent in both directions. The 
 methods are illustrated on recent stock price data for Thailand, 
 Malaysia and Indonesia. The period covers the recent Asian financial 
 crisis and enables us to assess whether breakpoints in domestic asset 
 return distributions are related to known changes in institutional 
 arrangements in the foreign currency markets of these countries.

Title: Alternative Methods for Measuring Productivity Growth 
Abstract: The present study is a contribution to the theory of the 
 measurement of productivity growth. First, it examines the 
 welfare-theoretic basis for measuring productivity growth and shows 
 that the ideal welfare-theoretic measure is a chain index of 
 productivity growth rates of different sectors which uses current 
 output weights. Second, it lays out a technique for decomposing 
 productivity growth which separates aggregate productivity growth into 
 three factors -- the pure productivity effect, the effect of changing 
 shares, and the effect of different productivity levels. Finally, it 
 shows how to apply the theoretically correct measure of productivity 
 growth and indicates which of the three different components should be
 included in a welfare-oriented measure of productivity growth. The 
 study concludes that none of the measures generally used to measure 
 productivity growth is consistent with the theoretically correct 
 measure.

Title: Does Democracy Engender Justice? 
Abstract: Many suppose that democracy is an ethos which includes, 
 inter alia, a degree of economic equality among citizens. In contrast, 
 we conceive of democracy as ruthless political competition between 
 groups of citizens, organized into parties. We inquire whether such 
 competition, which we assume to be concerned with distributive 
 matters, will engender economic equality in the long run. 
  
 The society consists of an infinite sequence of generations, each 
 comprised of adults and their children. Adults care about household 
 consumption, and the future wages of their children, which are 
 determined by educational policy. A given generation is characterized 
 by the distribution of wages earned by its adults. Parties form and 
 propose policies to redistribute income among households, and to 
 invest in the education of children; the educational policy that is 
 victorious determines the distribution of wages in the next generation 
 of adults. A political equilibrium concept is proposed which 
 determines two parties endogenously, and their proposed policies in 
 political competition. One party wins the election (stochastically). 
 This process determines a sequence of wage distributions across the 
 generations, and we ask: Under what conditions does the wage 
 distribution tend to one of equality? 
  
 We show that, under a technological assumption that appears to hold 
 empirically, there is no assurance that wage equality is eventually 
 achieved, but if certain 'social norms' hold, which restrict the space 
 of acceptable political policies, then equality is eventually 
 achieved. We suggest, moreover, that the social norms in question will 
 tend to hold, the more technologically developed the democracy is.

Title: Unilateral Deviation with Perfect Information 
Abstract: For extensive form games with perfect information, consider a 
 learning process in which, at any iteration, each player unilaterally 
 deviates to a best response to his current conjectures of others' 
 strategies; and then updates his conjectures in accordance with the 
 induced play of the game. We show that, for generic payoffs, the 
 outcome of the game becomes stationary in finite time, and is 
 consistent with Nash equilibrium. In general, if payoffs have ties or 
 if players observe more of each others' strategies than is revealed by 
 plays of the game, the same result holds provided a rationality 
 constraint is imposed on unilateral deviations: no player changes his 
 moves in subgames that he deems unreachable, unless he stands to 
 improve his payoff there. Moreover, with this constraint, the sequence 
 of strategies and conjectures also becomes stationary, and yields a 
 self- confirming equilibrium.

Title: The Effect of Bidders' Asymmetries on Expected Revenue in Auctions 
Abstract: Bidders' asymmetries are widespread in auction markets. 
 Yet, their impact on behavior and, ultimately, revenue and profits is
 still not well understood. In this paper, I define a natural benchmark
 auction environment to which to compare any private value auction with
 asymmetrically distributed valuations. I show that the expected revenue
 from the benchmark auction always dominates that from the asymmetric
 auction, both in the first price auction and the second price auction.
 These results formalize and make transparent the idea that competition is
 reduced by bidders' asymmetries. The paper also contributes to a better
 understanding of competition and the nature of rents in auction markets.
 Anonymity of the allocation mechanism seems to be an important factor.

Title: Forecasting New Zealand's Real GDP 
Abstract: Recent time series methods are applied to the problem of 
 forecasting New Zealand's real GDP. Model selection is conducted 
 within autoregressive (AR) and vector autoregressive (VAR) classes, 
 allowing for evolution in the form of the models over time. The 
 selections are performed using the Schwarz (1978) BIC and the 
 Phillips-Ploberger (1996) PIC criteria. The forecasts generated by the 
 data-determined AR models and an international VAR model are found to 
 be competitive with forecasts from fixed format models and forecasts 
 produced by the NZIER. Two illustrations of the methodology in 
 conditional forecasting settings are performed with the VAR models. 
 The first provides conditional predictions of New Zealand's real GDP 
 when there is a future recession in the United States. The second 
 gives conditional predictions of New Zealand's real GDP under a 
 variety of profiles that allow for tightening in monetary conditions 
 by the Reserve Bank.

Title: Entry and Vertical Differentiation 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the entry of new products into vertically 
 differentiated markets where an entrant and an incumbent compete in 
 quantities. The value of the new product is initially uncertain and 
 new information is generated through purchases in the market. We 
 derive the (unique) Markov perfect equilibrium of the infinite horizon 
 game under the strong long run average payoff criterion. 
  
 The qualitative features of the optimal entry strategy are shown to 
 depend exclusively on the relative ranking of established and new 
 products based on current beliefs. Superior products are launched 
 relatively slowly and at high initial prices whereas substitutes for 
 existing products are launched aggressively at low initial prices. 
  
 The robustness of these results with respect to different model 
 specifications is discussed.

Title: Investment Incentives in Procurement Auctions 
Abstract: We investigate firms' incentives for cost reduction in the 
 first price sealed bid auction, a format largely used for procurement.
 A central feature of the model is that we allow firms to be heterogeneous.
 Though private value first price auctions are not games with monotonic
 best responses, we find that for comparative statics purposes they behave
 like these games. In particular, firms will tend to underinvest in cost
 reduction because they anticipate fiercer head-on competition. Using the
 second price auction as a benchmark, we also find that the first price
 auction will elicit less investment from market participants. Moreover, 
 both auction formats tend to favor investment by the current market 
 leader and are therefore likely to reinforce asymmetries among market 
 participants.

Title: Global Games: Theory and Applications 
Abstract: Global games are games of incomplete information whose type 
 space is determined by the players each observing a noisy signal of 
 the underlying state. With strategic complementarities, global games 
 often have a unique, dominance solvable equilibrium, allowing analysis 
 of a number of economic models of coordination failure. For symmetric 
 binary action global games, equilibrium strategies in the limit (as 
 noise becomes negligible) are simple to characterize in terms of 
 'diffuse' beliefs over the actions of others. We describe a number of 
 economic applications that fall in this category. We also explore the 
 distinctive roles of public and private information in this setting, 
 review results for general global games, discuss the relationship 
 between global games and a literature on higher order beliefs in game 
 theory and describe the relationship to local interaction games and 
 dynamic games with payoff shocks.

Title: GMM Estimation of Autoregressive Roots Near Unity with Panel 
 Data 
Abstract: This paper investigates a generalized method of moments 
 (GMM) approach to the estimation of autoregressive roots near 
 unity with panel data. The two moment conditions studied are 
 obtained by constructing bias corrections to the score functions 
 under OLS and GLS detrending, respectively. It is shown that the 
 moment condition under GLS detrending corresponds to taking the 
 projected score on the Bhattacharya basis, linking the approach 
 to recent work on projected score methods for models with infinite 
 numbers of nuisance parameters (Waterman and Lindsay, 1998). 
 Assuming that the localizing parameter makes a nonpositive value, 
 we establish consistency of the GMM estimator and find its 
 limiting distribution. A notable new finding is that the GMM 
 estimator has convergence rate n^{1/6}, slower than root{n}, when 
 the true localizing parameter is zero (i.e., when there is a panel 
 unit root) and the deterministic trends in the panel are linear. 
 These results, which rely on boundary point asymptotics, point 
 to the continued difficulty of distinguishing unit roots from local 
 alternatives, even when there is an infinity of additional data.

Title: Does One Soros Make a Difference? A Theory of Currency Crises 
 with Large and Small Traders 
Abstract: Do large investors increase the vulnerability of a country 
 to speculative attacks in the foreign exchange markets? To address 
 this issue, we build a model of currency crises where a single large 
 investor and a continuum of small investors independently decide 
 whether to attack a currency based on their private information 
 about fundamentals. Even abstracting from signalling, the presence 
 of the large investor does make all other traders more aggressive 
 in their selling. Relative to the case in which there is no large 
 investors, small investors attack the currency when fundamentals are 
 stronger. Yet, the difference can be small, or null, depending on the 
 relative precision of private information of the small and large 
 investors. Adding signalling makes the influence of the large trader 
 on small traders' behaviour much stronger.

Title: How  to Compute Equilibrium Prices in 1891 
Abstract: Irving Fisher's Ph.D. thesis, submitted to Yale University in
 1891, contains a fully articulated general equilibrium model presented
 with the broad scope and formal mathematical clarity associated with
 Walras and his successors. In addition, Fisher presents a remarkable
 hydraulic apparatus for calculating equilibrium prices and the resulting
 distribution of society's endowments among the agents in the economy.

Title: Faulty Communication 
Abstract: The electronic mail game of Rubinstein (1989) showed that a 
 lack of common knowledge generated by faulty communication can make 
 coordinated action impossible. This paper shows how this conclusion is 
 robust to having a more realistic timing structure of messages, more 
 than two players who meet publicly but not as a plenary group, and may 
 be robust to strategic decisions about whether to communicate.

Title: Optimal Inventory Policies When Sales Are Discretionary 
Abstract: Inventory models customarily assume that demand is fully 
 satisfied if sufficient stock is available. We analyze the form of the
 optimal inventory policy if the inventory manager can choose to meet a
 fraction of the demand. Under classical conditions we show that the
 optimal policy is again of the (S,s) form. The analysis makes use of a
 novel property of K-concave functions.

Title: Equivalence of the Higher-order Asymptotic Efficiency of k-step 
 and Extremum Statistics 
Abstract: It is well known that a one-step scoring estimator that 
 starts from any N^{1/2}-consistent estimator has the same first-order 
 asymptotic efficiency as the maximum likelihood estimator. This paper 
 extends this result to k-step estimators and test statistics for 
 k >= 1, higher-order asymptotic efficiency, and general extremum 
 estimators and test statistics. The paper shows that a k-step 
 estimator has the same higher-order asymptotic efficiency, to any 
 given order, as the extremum estimator towards which it is stepping, 
 provided (i) k is sufficiently large, (ii) some smoothness and moment 
 conditions hold, and (iii) a condition on the initial estimator holds. 
  
 For example, for the Newton-Raphson k-step estimator, we obtain 
 asymptotic equivalence to integer order s provided 2^{k} >= s + 1. 
 Thus, for k = 1, 2, and 3, one obtains asymptotic equivalence to 
 first, third, and seventh orders respectively. This means that the 
 maximum differences between the probabilities that the 
 (N^{1/2}-normalized) k-step and extremum estimators lie in any convex 
 set are o(1), o(N^{-3/2}), and o(N^{-3}) respectively.

Title: Pooled Log Periodogram Regression 
Abstract: Estimation of the memory parameter in time series with long 
 range dependence is considered. A pooled log periodogram regression 
 estimator is proposed that utilizes a set of mL periodogram ordinates 
 with L approaching infinity rather than m ordinates used in the 
 conventional log periodogram estimator. Consistency and asymptotic 
 normality of the pooled regression estimator are established. The 
 pooled estimator is shown to have smaller variance but larger bias 
 than the conventional log periodogram estimator. Finite sample 
 performance is assessed in simulations, and the methods are 
 illustrated in an empirical application with inflation and stock 
 returns.

Title: Local Whittle Estimation in Nonstationary and Unit Root Cases 
Abstract: Asymptotic properties of the local Whittle estimator in the 
 nonstationary case (d > 1/2) are explored. For 1/2 < d < 1, the 
 estimator is shown to be consistent, and its limit distribution and 
 the rate of convergence depend on the value of d. For d = 1, the 
 limit distribution is mixed normal. For d  > 1 and when the process 
 has a linear trend, the estimator is shown to be inconsistent and to 
 converge in probability to unity.

Title: Modified Local Whittle Estimation of the Memory Parameter in 
 the Nonstationary Case 
Abstract: Semiparametric estimation of the memory parameter is studied 
 in models of fractional integration in the nonstationary case, and some
 new representation theory for the discrete Fourier transform of a
 fractional process is used to assist in the analysis. A limit theory is
 developed for an estimator of the memory parameter that covers a range
 of values of d commonly encountered in applied work with economic data.
 The new estimator is called the modified local Whittle estimator and
 employs a version of the Whittle likelihood based on frequencies adjacent
 to the origin and modified to take into account the form of the data
 generating mechanism in the frequency domain. The modified local Whittle
 estimator is shown to be consistent for 0 < d <2 and is asymptotically
 normally distributed with variance 1/4 for 1/2 < d < 7/4. The approach
 allows for likelihood-based inference about d in a context that includes 
 nonstationary data, is agnostic about short memory components and permits
 the construction of valid confidence regions for d that extend into the
 nonstationary region.

Title: A Bias-Reduced Log-Periodogram Regression Estimator for the 
 Long-Memory Parameter 
Abstract: The widely used log-periodogram regression estimator of 
 the long-memory parameter d proposed by Geweke and Porter-Hudak (1983) 
 (GPH) has been criticized because of its finite-sample bias, see 
 Agiakloglou, Newbold, and Wohar (1993). In this paper, we propose 
 a simple bias-reduced log-periodogram regression estimator, {d hat}r, 
 that eliminates the first- and higher-order biases of the GPH 
 estimator. The bias-reduced estimator is the same as the GPH 
 estimator except that one includes frequencies to the power 2k for 
 k = 1,...,r, for some positive integer r, as  additional regressors 
 in the pseudo-regression model that yields the GPH estimator. The 
 reduction in bias is obtained using assumptions on the spectrum only 
 in a neighborhood of the zero frequency, which is consistent with 
 the semiparametric nature of the long-memory model under 
 consideration. 
  
 Following the work of Robinson (1995b) and Hurvich, Deo, and Brodsky 
 (1998), we establish the asymptotic bias, variance, and mean-squared 
 error (MSE) of {d hat}r, determine the MSE optimal choice of the 
 number of frequencies, m to include in the regression, and establish 
 the asymptotic normality of {d hat}r. These results show that the 
 bias of {d hat}r goes to zero at a faster rate than that of the GPH 
 estimator when the normalized spectrum at zero is sufficiently smooth, 
 but that its variance only is increased by a multiplicative constant. 
 In consequence, the optimal rate of convergence to zero of the MSE 
 of {d hat}dr is faster than that of the GPH estimator. We establish 
 the optimal rate of convergence of a minimax risk criterion for 
 estimators of d when the normalized spectral density is in a class 
 that includes those that are smooth of order s > 1 at zero. We show 
 that the bias-reduced estimator {d hat}r attains this rate when 
 r > (s-2)/2 and m is chosen appropriately. For s > 2, the GPH 
 estimator does not attain this rate. The proof of these results uses 
 results of Giraitis, Robinson, and Samarov (1997). Some Monte Carlo 
 simulation results for stationary Gaussian ARFIMA(1,d,1) models show 
 that the bias-reduced estimators perform well relative to the 
 standard log-periodogram estimator.

Title: Information and the Existence of Stationary Markovian 
 Equilibrium 
Abstract: We describe conditions for the existence of a stationary 
 Markovian equilibrium when total production or total endowment 
 is a random variable. Apart from regularity assumptions, there 
 are two crucial conditions: (i) low information -- agents are 
 ignorant of both total endowment and their own endowments when 
 they make decisions in a given period, and (ii) proportional 
 endowments -- the endowment of each agent is in proportion, 
 possibly a random proportion, to the total endowment. When these 
 conditions	hold, there is a stationary equilibrium. When they 
 do not hold, such equilibrium need not exist.

Title: Rethinking Multiple Equilibria in Macroeconomic Modelling 
Abstract: Are beliefs as indeterminate as suggested by models with 
 multiple equilibria? Multiplicity of equilibria arise largely as the 
 unintended consequence of two modelling assumptions -- the 
 fundamentals are assumed to be common knowledge, and economic agents
 know others' actions in equilibrium. Both are questionable. When others'
 actions are not known with certainty, such as when actions rely on noisy
 signals, self-fulfilling beliefs lead to a unique outcome determined by
 the fundamentals and the knowledges that others are rational. This paper
 illustrates this approach in the context of a model of bank runs and
 other similar applications. Such an approach places comparative statics
 and policy analyses on a firmer footing. It also suggests that public
 information has a disproportionately larger impact on the outcome than
 private information.

Title: Social Security Investment in Equities in an Economy with 
 Short-Term Production and Land 
Abstract: This paper explores the general equilibrium impact of social 
 security portfolio diversification into private securities, either 
 through the trust fund or via private accounts. The analysis depends 
 critically on heterogeneity in saving, in production, in assets, and 
 in taxes. Under fairly general assumptions we show that limited 
 diversification increases a neutral social welfare function, increases 
 interest rates, reduces the expected return on short-term equity 
 (and thus the equity premium), decreases safe investment and increases 
 risky investment. However, the effect on aggregate investment, 
 long-term capital values, and the utility of young savers hinges on 
 delicate assumptions about technology. Aggregate investment and 
 long-term asset values often move in the opposite direction. Thus 
 social security diversification might reduce long-term equity value 
 while it increases aggregate investment.

Title: Estimated, Calibrated, and Optimal Interest Rate Rules 
Abstract: Estimated, calibrated, and optimal interest rate rules are 
 examined for their ability to dampen economic fluctuations caused by 
 random shocks. A tax rate rule is also considered. The results show 
 that the estimated interest rate rule used in the paper is stable for 
 the period beginning in 1954 except for the early Volcker period, 
 although more observations, especially high inflation ones, are 
 needed before much confidence can be placed on the results. 
  
 The models used for the stabilization results are large scale 
 structural macroeconometric models, and some of the results differ 
 from those based on small models. For example, rules with inflation 
 coefficients less than one are not destabilizing, and rules with large 
 inflation coefficients, such as the Taylor rule, achieve a small 
 reduction in inflation  variability at a cost of a large increase 
 in interest rate variability.

Title: Inside and Outside Money, Gains to Trade, and IS-LM 
Abstract: We build a one-period general equilibrium model with money. 
 Equilibrium exists, and fiat money has positive value, as long as the 
 ratio of outside money to inside money is less than the gains to trade 
 available at autarky. We show that the nominal effects of government 
 fiscal and monetary policy can be completely described by a diagram 
 identical in form to the IS-LM curves introduced by Hicks to describe 
 Keynes' general theory. IS-LM analysis is thus not incompatible with 
 full market clearing, multiple commodities, and heterogeneous 
 households. We show that as the government deficit approaches a finite 
 threshold, hyperinflation sets in (prices converge to infinity and 
 real trade collapses). If the government surplus is too large, the 
 economy enters a liquidity trap in which nominal GNP sinks and 
 monetary policy is ineffectual.

Title: Cartoons of the Variation of Financial Prices and of Brownian 
 Motions in Multifractal Time 
Abstract: This article describes a versatile family of functions 
 increasingly roughened by successive interpolations. They provide 
 models of the variation of financial prices. More importantly, they 
 are helpful "cartoons" of Brownian motions in multifractal time, BMMT, 
 which are better models described in the next article. Ordinary 
 Brownian motion and two models the author proposed in the 1960s 
 correspond to special cartoons. More general cartoons are richer in 
 structure but (by choice) remain parsimonious and easily computed. 
 Their outputs reproduce the main features of financial prices: 
 continually varying volatility, discontinuity or concentration, 
 and other events far outside the mildly behaving Brownian "norm."

Title: Competitive Prizes: When Less Scrutiny Induces More Effort 
Abstract: We consider a principal who is keen to induce his agents to 
 work at their maximal effort levels. To this end, he samples n days 
 at random out of the T days on which they work, and awards a prize 
 of B dollars to the most productive agent. The principal's policy 
 (B,n) induces a strategic game Gamma(B,n) between the agents. We 
 show that to implement maximal effort levels weakly (or, strongly) 
 as a strategic equilibrium (or, as dominant strategies) in 
 Gamma(B,n), at the least cost B to himself, the principal must 
 choose a small sample size n. Thus less scrutiny by the principal 
 induces more effort from the agents.
  
 The need for reduced scrutiny becomes more pronounced when agents 
 have information of the history of past plays in the game. There is 
 an inverse relation between information and optimal sample size. As 
 agents acquire more information (about each other), the principal 
 -- so to speak -- must "undo" this by reducing his information 
 (about them) and choosing the sample size n even smaller.

Title: Optimal Scrutiny in Multi-Period Promotion Tournaments 
Abstract: Consider a principal who hires heterogeneous agents to work 
 for him over T periods, without prior knowledge of their respective 
 skills, and intends to promote one of them at the end. In each period 
 the agents choose effort levels and produce random outputs, 
 independently of each other, and are fully informed of the past 
 history of outputs. The principal's major objective is to maximize 
 the total expected output, but he may also put some weight on 
 detecting the higher-skilled agent for promotion. To this end, he 
 randomly samples n out of the T periods and awards the promotion to 
 the agent who produces more on the sample. This determines an 
 extensive form game Gamma (T,n), which we analyze for its subgame 
 perfect equilibria in behavioral strategies. 
  
 We show that the principal will do best to always choose a small 
 sample size n. More precisely, if eta(T) is the maximal optimal 
 sample size, then eta(T)/T approaches 0 as T approaches infinity.

Title: The Theory of Money 
Abstract: Fiat money(1) is a creation of both the state and society. 
 Its value is supported by expectations which are conditioned by the 
 dynamics of trust in government, the socio-economic structure and by 
 outside events such as wars, plagues or political unrest. 
  
 The micro-management of a dynamic economy is not far removed in 
 difficulty from the micro-management of the weather. However, money 
 and the financial institutions and instruments of a modern economy 
 provide the means to influence expectations and bound behavior.(2) 
  
 Paper money emerges as a virtual commodity. The dynamics of the 
 economy permits it to serve as an imaginary gold.Although it is an 
 abstraction, it is meaningful to talk about its quantity. Closely 
 related to but basically different from fiat money is credit.(3) 
 Credit, unlike fiat money is not a virtual commodity but a two party 
 contract. The fact that it is a two party contract set in a dynamic 
 context implies that there are chances that the economy may reach a 
 state where a debtor is unable to meet his or her obligations. When 
 this happens the laws and customs of the society must provide default, 
 bankruptcy and reorganization rules. These rules are usually 
 denominated in terms of fiat and socio-economic penalties such as the 
 confiscation of assets, garnishing of salary or time in debtors' 
 prison. Thus the value of paper gold is determined in two ways by the 
 dynamics of the system. First by acceptance in trade, based on the 
 expectation that it will remain valuable and second by its role in the 
 discharge of debts where failure to repay has unpleasant consequences. 
 When taxes are present a third valuation appears in the penalties for 
 failure to pay taxes. 
  
 The control of the fiat money supply together with rules on the 
 granting of credit and the bankruptcy, default and reorganization 
 rules,in essence, provide lower and upper bounds for the price level 
 in the economy. They also determine the innovation rate of the 
 economy. An innovation may be regarded as an economic mutation; the 
 less costly failure is, the more likely an innovation will be risked. 
  
 The rates of interest for loans combined with the harshness of the 
 bankruptcy and reorganization laws help to determine the rate of 
 innovation in a society. Government controls only one among many 
 interest rates. A host of institutional details involving risk and 
 transactions cost determine the others. 
  
 The velocity of both money and credit may vary. Even though velocity 
 may vary, human decision-making takes a finite amount of time. This 
 implies that velocity will remain bounded. Beyond some speed of 
 circulation expectations will degenerate and the economy will break 
 down. 
  
 In order to appreciate the intrinsic dynamics of a high information 
 and  communication mass economy at least three agents must be 
 distinguished. They are the highly visible government; other largely 
 visible legal persons, such as banks and corporations and real 
 persons. Their differences are characterized by their relative power 
 and the size of their communication networks. 
  
 The contrast between a market economy and a state economy is not a 
 clean contrast. The distinctions are on a continuum. Among modern 
 democratic market economies the size of the government sector is 
 roughly anywhere from 15% to 50% of the economy. Thus the control 
 description of virtually any modern economy is of one extremely large 
 and visible player; at most a few hundred large corporate entities of 
 reasonably high visibility and a mass of small agents known by and in 
 direct communication with only a few others. 
  
 The reconciliation of a dynamics oriented macro-economics with an 
 equilibrium oriented micro-economics lies in the understanding that 
 the economy is embedded in the polity and society. The institutions, 
 customs and laws are the carriers of process and provide bounds to 
 process. They limit the dynamics.The role of macroeconomic policy is 
 to bound the dynamics of an evolving society. Individual behavior is 
 local and necessarily myopic. Myopic local optimization is consistent 
 with global evolution. 
  
 An elementary understanding of history and the decision and game 
 theory proliferation of strategies is enough to indicate that the 
 search for a unique or even stationary economic dynamics is an essay 
 in futility.In contrast the search for the correct carriers and bounds 
 on process is feasible.The monetary structure provides the sufficient 
 loose coupling to permit mass independent behavior to take place even 
 somewhat chaotically within institutional bounds.(4) 
  
 1. I use the term fiat or abstract paper money interchangeably to 
 stand for a government supplied means of payment of no intrinsic 
 worth. 
 2. Phrasing this somewhat more technically they provide the bounds on 
 the state space. A state space is the set of all feasible states which 
 can be achieved by the system. 
 3. Credit such as bank credit from a well known bank may be referred 
 to as "inside money" in the sense that it is a contract between two 
 legal persons in the economy other than the government. Yet the bank 
 credit, because of the visibility and reputation of the bank, may 
 serve as a substitute in transactions for fiat money. 
 4. Technically the institutions and the monetary and financial structure 
 fully define the state space, but do not describe the dynamics. There is 
 a robust collection of local individual rules of behavior which are all 
 sufficient to provide the dynamic support of expectations that money 
 will be accepted as having value. The control system may be sufficient 
 to guide or at least limit the overall macroeconomic behavior without 
 necessarily providing for a precise or unique dynamics. Money is the 
 only financial instrument without an offsetting instrument. This 
 nonsymmetry appears to be critical in the introduction of time into 
 the model of the economy.

Title: Asymptotics in Minimum Distance from Independence Estimation 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a family of minimum distance from
 independence estimators, suggested by Manski's minimum mean square from
 independence estimator. We establish strong consistency, asymptotic
 normality and consistency of resampling estimates of the distribution
 and variance of these estimators. For Manski's estimator we derive both
 strong consistency and asymptotic normality.

Title: Bootstrap Unit Root Tests in Panels with Cross-Sectional 
 Dependency 
Abstract: We apply bootstrap methodology to unit root tests for 
 dependent panels with N cross-sectional units and T time series 
 observations. More specifically, we let each panel be driven by a 
 general linear process which may be different across cross-sectional 
 units, and approximate it by a finite order autoregressive integrated 
 process of order increasing with T. As we allow the dependency among 
 the innovations generating the individual panels, we construct our 
 unit root tests from the estimation of the system of the entire N 
 panels. The limit distributions of the tests are derived by passing 
 T to infinity, with N fixed. We then apply the bootstrap method to the 
 approximated autoregressions to obtain the critical values for the 
 panel unit root tests, and establish the asymptotic validity of such 
 bootstrap panel unit root tests under general conditions. The proposed 
 bootstrap tests are indeed quite general covering a wide class of 
 panel models. They in particular allow for very general dynamic 
 structures which may vary across individual units, and more importantly
 for the presence of arbitrary cross-sectional dependency. The finite
 sample performance of the bootstrap tests is examined via simulations,
 and compared to that of the t-bar statistics by Im, Pesaran and Shin
 (1997), which is one of the commonly used unit root tests for panel
 data. We find that our bootstrap panel unit root tests perform well
 relative to the t-bar statistics, especially when N is small.

Title: On the Number of Bootstrap Repetitions for BC_a Confidence
 Intervals 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of choosing the number  
 bootstrap repetitions B to use with the BC_{a} bootstrap confidence 
 intervals introduced by Efron (1987). Because the simulated random 
 variables are ancillary, we seek a choice of B that yields a 
 confidence interval that is close to the ideal bootstrap confidence 
 interval for which B = infinity. We specifiy a three-step method of 
 choosing B that ensures that the lower and upper lengths of the 
 confidence interval deviate from those of the ideal bootstrap 
 confidence interval by at most a small percentage with high 
 probability.

Title: Bargaining and Markets: Complexity and the Walrasian Outcome 
Abstract: Rubinstein and Wolinsky (1990b) consider a simple 
 decentralized market in which agents either meet randomly or choose 
 their partners volunatarily and bargain over the terms on which they 
 are willing to trade. Intuition suggests that if there are no 
 transaction costs, the outcome of this matching and bargaining game 
 should be the unique competitive equilibrium. This does not happen. 
 In fact, Rubinstein and Wolinsky show that any price can be sustained 
 as a sequential equilibrium of this game. In this paper, I consider 
 Rubinstein and Wolinsky's model and show that if the complexity costs 
 of implementing strategies enter players' preferences (lexicographically),
 together with the standard payoff in the game, then the only equilibrium
 that survives is the unique competitive outcome. This will be done both
 for the random matching and for the voluntary matching models. Thus the
 paper demonstrates that complexity costs might have a role in providing
 a justification for the competitive outcome.

Title: Information Acquisition and Efficient Mechanism Design 
Abstract: We consider a general mechanism design setting where each 
 agent can acquire (covert) information before participating in the 
 mechanism. The central question is whether a mechanism exists which 
 provides the efficient incentives for information acquisition ex-ante 
 and implements the efficient allocation conditional on the private 
 information ex-post. 
  
 It is shown that in every private value environment the 
 Vickrey-Groves-Clark mechanism guarantees both ex-ante as well as 
 ex-post efficiency. In contract, with common values, ex-ante and 
 ex-post efficiency cannot be reconciled in general. Sufficient 
 conditions in terms of sub- and supermodularity are provided when 
 (all) ex-post efficient mechanisms lead to private under- or 
 over-acquisition of information

Title: Default in a General Equilibrium Model with Incomplete Markets 
Abstract: We extend the standard model of general equilibrium with 
 incomplete markets (GEI) to allow for default. The equilibrating 
 variables include aggregate default levels, as well as prices of 
 assets and commodities. Default can be either strategic, or due to 
 ill-fortune. It can be caused by events directly affecting the 
 borrower, or indirectly as part of a chain reaction in which a 
 borrower cannot repay because he himself has not been repaid. 
  
 Each asset is defined by its promises A, the penalties lambda for 
 default, and the limitations Q on its sale. The model is thus named 
 GE(A,lambda,Q). Each asset is regarded as a pool of promises. 
 Different sellers will often exercise their default options 
 differently, while each buyer of an asset receives the same pro rata 
 share of all deliveries. This model of assets represents for example 
 the securitized mortgage market and the securitized credit card 
 market. 
  
 Given any collection of assets, we prove that equilibrium exists under 
 conditions similar to those necessary to guarantee the existence of 
 GEI equilibrium. We argue that default is thus reasonably modeled as 
 an equilibrium phenomenon. Moreover, we show that more lenient lambda 
 which encourage default may be Pareto improving because they allow for 
 better risk spreading.
  
 Our definition of equilibrium includes a condition on expected 
 deliveries for untraded assets that is similar to the trembling hand 
 refinements used in game theory. Using this condition, we argue that 
 the possibility of default is an important factor in explaining which 
 assets are traded in equilibrium. Asset promises, default penalties, 
 and quantity constraints can all be thought of as determined 
 endogenously by the forces of supply and demand. Our model encompasses 
 a broad range of moral hazard, adverse selection, and signalling 
 phenomena (including the Akerlof lemons model and Rothschild-Stiglitz 
 insurance model) in a general equilibrium framework. Many authors 
 (including Akerlof , Rothschild and Stiglitz) have suggested that 
 equilibrium may not exist in the presence of adverse selection. But 
 our existence theorem shows that it must. The problem is the 
 inefficiency of the resulting equilibrium, not its nonexistence. 
 The power of perfect competition simplifies many of the complications 
 attending the finite player, game theoretic analyses of the same 
 topics. 
  
 The Modigliani-Miller theorem typically fails to hold when there is 
 the possibility that the firm or one of its investors might default.

Title: Maximum Likelihood Estimation in Panels with Incidental Trends 
Abstract: It is shown that the maximum likelihood estimator of a local 
 to unity parameter can be consistently estimated with panel data when 
 the cross section observations are independent. Consistency applies 
 when there are no deterministic trends or when there is a homogeneous 
 deterministic trend in the panel model. When there are heterogeneous

Title: Nonlinear Econometric Models with Cointegrated and 
 Deterministically Trending Regressors 
Abstract: This paper develops an asymptotic theory for a general class 
 of nonlinear nonstationary regressions, extending earlier work by 
 Phillips and Hansen (1990) on linear cointegrating regressions. The 
 model considered accommodates a linear time trend and stationary 
 regressors, as well as multiple I(1) regressors. We establish 
 consistency and derive the limit distribution of the nonlinear least 
 squares estimator. The estimator is consistent under fairly general 
 conditions but the convergence rate and the limiting distribution are 
 critically dependent upon the type of the regression function. For 
 integrable regression functions, the parameter estimates converge at a 
 reduced n^{1/4} rate and have mixed normal limit distributions. On the 
 other hand, if the regression functions are homogeneous at infinity, 
 the convergence rates are determined by the degree of the asymptotic 
 homogeneity and the limit distributions are non-Gaussian. It is shown 
 that nonlinear least squares generally yields inefficient estimators 
 and invalid tests, just as in linear nonstationary regressions. The 
 paper proposes a methodology to overcome such difficulties. The 
 approach is simple to implement, produces efficient estimates and 
 leads to tests that are asymptotically chi-square. It is implemented 
 in empirical applications in much the same way as the fully modified 
 estimator of Phillips and Hansen.

Title: Unit Root Log Periodogram Regression 
Abstract: Log periodogram (LP) regression is shown to be consistent 
 and to have a mixed normal limit distribution when the memory 
 parameter d = 1. Gaussian errors are not required. Tests of d = 1 
 based on LP regression are consistent against d < 1 alternatives 
 but inconsistent against d > 1 alternatives. A test based on a 
 modified LP regression that is consistent in both directions is 
 provided.

Title: Discrete Fourier Transforms of Fractional Processes 
Abstract: Discrete Fourier transforms (dft's) of fractional processes 
 are studied and an exact representation of the dft is given in terms 
 of the component data. The new representation gives the frequency 
 domain form of the model for a fractional process, and is particularly 
 useful in analyzing the asymptotic behavior of the dft and periodogram 
 in the nonstationary case when the memory parameter d >= 1/2. Various 
 asymptotic approximations are suggested. It is shown that smoothed 
 periodogram spectral estimates remain consistent for frequencies away 
 from the origin in the nonstationary case provided the memory 
 parameter d < 1. When d = 1, the spectral estimates are inconsistent 
 and converge weakly to random variates. Applications of the theory to 
 log periodogram regression and local Whittle estimation of the memory 
 parameter are discussed and some modified versions of these procedures 
 are suggested.

Title: Political Correctness 
Abstract: An informed advisor wishes to convey her valuable information 
 to an uninformed decision maker with identical preferences. Thus she 
 has a current incentive to truthfully reveal her information. But if 
 the decision maker thinks the advisor might be biased in favor of one 
 decision, and the advisor does not wish to be thought to be biased, 
 the advisor has a reputational incentive to lie. If the advisor is 
 sufficiently concerned about her reputation, no information is 
 conveyed in equilibrium. In a repeated version of this game, the 
 advisor will care (instrumentally) about her reputation simply 
 because she wants her valuable and unbiased advice to have an impact 
 on future decisions.

Title: Coordination Risk and the Price of Debt 
Abstract: Creditors of a distressed borrower face a coordination 
 problem. Even if the fundamentals are sound, fear of premature 
 foreclosure by others may lead to pre-emptive action, undermining the 
 project. Recognition of this problem lies behind corporate bankruptcy 
 provisions across the world, and it has been identified as a culprit 
 in international financial crises, but has received scant attention 
 from the literature on debt pricing. Without common knowledge of 
 fundamentals, the incidence of failure is uniquely determined provided 
 that private information is precise enough. This affords a way to 
 price the coordination failure. Comparative statics on the unique 
 equilibrium provides several insights on the role of information and 
 the incidence of inefficient liquidation.

Title: Coordination Risk and the Price of Debt 
Abstract: Creditors of a distressed borrower face a coordination 
 problem. Even if the fundamentals are sound, fear of premature 
 foreclosure by others may lead to pre-emptive action, undermining the 
 project. Recognition of this problem lies behind corporate bankruptcy 
 provisions across the world, and it has been identified as a culprit 
 in international financial crises, but has received scant attention 
 from the literature on debt pricing. The apparent multiplicity of 
 equilibria is a barrier to development of this issue in asset pricing, 
 but this multiplicity is only apparent. Without common knowledge of 
 fundamentals, the incidence of failure is uniquely determined provided 
 that private information is precise enough. This affords a way to 
 price the coordination failure. There are two further conclusions. 
 First, coordination is more difficult to sustain when fundamentals 
 deteriorate. Thus, when fundamentals deteriorate, the onset of crisis 
 can be very swift. Second, "transparency" -- in the sense of greater 
 provision of information to the market -- does not generally mitigate 
 the coordination problem. Transparency is not a panacea.

Title: World Income Components: Measuring and Exploiting Risk-Sharing 
 Opportunities 
Abstract: We provide a method for decomposing the variance of changes 
 in incomes in the world into components, world income components 
 (WICs), in such a way as to indicate the most important risk-sharing 
 opportunities among people of the world. 
  
 We develop a constant absolute risk premium model, an intertemporal 
 general equilibrium model of the world that facilitates consideration 
 of optimal contract design. We show that for a contract designer 
 maximizing a social welfare function, the optimal risk-management 
 contracts maximize the equilibrium world real interest rate. That is 
 the contract designer achieves the risk-optimal interest rate. We 
 show that these WIC securities are defined in terms of eigenvectors 
 of a transformed variance matrix of income changes. The method is 
 applied with a variance matrix estimated using Penn World Table data 
 on the G-7 countries, 1950-92.

Title: Strategic Buyers and Privately Observed Prices 
Abstract: A model of repeated price competition with large buyers is 
 analyzed. The sellers are allowed to offer different prices to 
 different buyers and the buyers act strategically. The set of subgame 
 perfect Equilibria is investigated under public and private 
 monitoring. 
  
 With public monitoring the equilibrium set with large buyers expands 
 relative to the standard model where each buyer is small and behaves 
 myopically. With private monitoring, where prices are not observable 
 to the competing sellers, the set of equilibrium payoffs shrinks. In 
 the finitely repeated game with private monitoring, all sales are made 
 by the efficient seller. In the infinitely repeated game this result 
 is preserved as long as the sellers condition their prices on the 
 public history. In contrast to the finite horizon game, the set of 
 pure strategy equilibria expands if the sellers are allowed to 
 condition their own past prices. Comparisons are drawn to Markovian 
 equilibria of similar dynamic games.

Title: Repeated Games with Almost-Public Monitoring 
Abstract: In repeated games with imperfect public monitoring, players can
 use public signals to coordinate their behavior perfectly, and thus
 support cooperative outcomes with the threat of punishments. But with
 even a small amount of private monitoring, players' private histories
 may lead them to have sufficiently different views of the world that such
 coordination on punishments is no longer possible (we describe a simple
 strategy profile that is a perfect public equilibrium of a repeated
 prisoner's dilemma with imperfect public monitoring, and yet is not an
 equilibrium for arbitrarily close games with private monitoring). If a
 perfect public equilibrium has players' behavior conditioned only on
 finite histories, then it induces an equilibrium in all close-by games
 with private monitoring. This implies a folk theorem for repeated games
 with almost-public almost-perfect monitoring.

Title: Contractual Intermediaries 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the role of third party intermediaries, 
 such as courts and arbitrators, in contract enforcement. In our model,
 intermediaries compel contracted transfers and resolve disputes when
 requested to do so by the contracting agents. When the verifiability
 of information is limited, successful enforcement requires that dispute
 resolution costs be sufficiently great. Optimal enforcement systems
 economize on dispute resolution and information costs, and may involve
 establishment of specific systems tailored to particular groups. We
 show further that the "holdup problem" may be resolved via an
 appropriately designed dispute resolution system.

Title: Consistent Model and Moment Selection Criteria for GMM 
 Estimation with Applications to Dynamic Panel Data Models 
Abstract: This paper develops consistent model and moment selection 
 criteria for GMM estimation. The criteria select the correct model 
 specification and all correct moment conditions asymptotically. The 
 selection criteria resemble the widely used likelihood-based selection
 criteria BIC, HQIC, and AIC. (The latter is not consistent.) The GMM
 selection criteria are based on the J statistic for testing
 over-identifying restrictions. Bonus terms reward the use of fewer 
 parameters for a given number of moment conditions and the use of more
 moment conditions for a given number of parameters. 
  
 The paper applies the model and moment selection criteria to dynamic 
 panel data models with unobserved individual effects. The paper shows 
 how to apply the selection criteria to select the lag length for lagged
 dependent variables, to detect the number and locations of structural
 breaks, to determine the exogeneity of regressors, and/or to determine
 the existence of correlation between some regressors and the individual
 effect. 
  
 To illustrate the finite sample performance of the selection criteria 
 and their impact on parameter estimation, the paper reports the 
 results of a Monte Carlo experiment on a dynamic panel data model.

 This paper builds a theoretical framework to compare three alternative
 supply structures: vertical integration, networks, and markets. The
 analysis considers the relationship between uncertainty in demand for
 specific inputs, investment costs, and industrial structure. It shows
 that network structures are more likely when productive assets are
 expensive and firms experience large idiosyncratic shocks in demand.
 The analysis is supported by existing evidence and provides empirical
 predictions as to the shape of different industries.

 Bootstrap for Extremum Estimators 
Abstract: This paper establishes the higher-order equivalence of the 
 k-step bootstrap, introduced recently by Davidson and MacKinnon 
 (1999a), and the standard bootstrap. The k-step bootstrap is a very 
 attractive alternative computationally to the standard bootstrap for 
 statistics based on nonlinear extremum estimators, such as generalized 
 method of moment and maximum likelihood estimators. The paper also 
 extends results of Hall and Horowitz (1996) to provide new results 
 regarding the higher-order improvements of the standard bootstrap and 
 the k-step bootstrap for extremum estimators (compared to procedures 
 based on first-order asymptotics). 
  
 The results of the paper apply to Newton-Raphson (NR), default NR, 
 line-search NR, and Gauss-Newton k-step bootstrap procedures. The 
 results apply to the nonparametric iid bootstrap, non-overlapping and 
 overlapping block bootstraps, and restricted and unrestricted 
 parametric bootstraps. The results cover symmetric and equal-tailed 
 two-sided t tests and confidence intervals, one-sided t tests and 
 confidence intervals, Wald tests and confidence regions, and J tests 
 of over-identifying restrictions.

Title: Testing When a Parameter Is on the Boundary of the Maintained 
 Hypothesis 
Abstract: This paper considers testing problems where several of the 
 standard regularity conditions fail to hold. We consider the case 
 where (i) parameter vectors in the null hypothesis may lie on the 
 boundary of the maintained hypothesis and (ii) there may be a 
 nuisance parameter that appears under the alternative hypothesis, 
 but not under the null. The paper establishes the asymptotic null and 
 local alternative distributions of quasi-likelihood ratio, rescaled 
 quasi-likelihood ratio, Wald, and score tests in this case. The 
 results apply to tests based on a wide variety of extremum estimators 
 and apply to a wide variety of models. 
  
 Examples treated in the paper are: (1) tests of the null hypothesis 
 of no conditional heteroskedasticity in a GARCH(1, 1) regression 
 model and (2) tests of the null hypothesis that some random 
 coefficients have variances equal to zero in a random coefficients 
 regression model with (possibly) correlated random coefficients. 
Keywords: Asymptotic distribution, boundary, conditional 
 heteroskedasticity, extremum estimator, GARCH model, inequality 
 restrictions, likelihood ratio test, local power, maximum likelihood 
 estimator, parameter restrictions, random coefficients regression, 
 quasi-maximum likelihood estimator, quasi-likelihood ratio test, 
 restricted estimator, score test, Wald test

Title: An Empirical Model of Inventory Investment by Durable 
 Commodity Intermediaries 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new detailed data set of 
 high-frequency observations on inventory investment by a U.S. steel 
 wholesaler. Our analysis of these data leads to six main conclusions: 
 orders and sales are made infrequently; orders are more volatile than 
 sales; order sizes vary considerably; there is substantial
 high-frequency variation in the firm's sales prices; inventory/sales 
 ratios are unstable; and there are occasional stockouts. We model 
 the firm generically as a durable commodity intermediary that engages 
 in commodity price speculation. We demonstrate that the firm's 
 inventory investment behavior at the product level is well
 approximated by an optimal trading strategy from the solution to a 
 nonlinear dynamic programming problem with two continuous state 
 variables and one continuous control variable that is subject to 
 frequently binding inequality constraints. We show that the optimal 
 trading strategy is a generalized (S,s) rule. That is, whenever the 
 firm's inventory level q falls below the order threshold s(p) the 
 firm places an order of size S(p) - q in order to attain a target 
 inventory level S(p) satisfying S(p) >= s(p), where p is the current 
 spot price at which the firm can purchase unlimited amounts of the 
 commodity after incurring a fixed order cost K. We show that the 
 (S,s) bands are decreasing functions of p, capturing the basic 
 intuition of commodity price speculation, namely, that it is optimal 
 for the firm to hold higher inventories when the spot price is low 
 than when it is high in order to profit from "buying low and selling 
 high." We simulate a calibrated version of this model and show that 
 the simulated data exhibit the key features of inventory investment 
 we observe in the data.

Title: Toward a Theory of Reinsurance and Retrocession 
Abstract: There is a natural tradeoff between the benefits of 
 increasing the number of competitors in an insurance market and the 
 drawback to the weakening of the law of large numbers due to the 
 diminishing of average reserves. In this investigation we consider 
 the possibility for optimal layers of reinsurance and retrocession 
 in the design of the insurance industry. A general question which 
 may be asked of all financial institutions is what factors limit 
 the number of layers of paper which can be constructed?

Title: Entry and Innovation in Vertically Differentiated Markets 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the optimal entry into experience goods 
 markets with vertically differentiated buyers. We consider the case 
 where the value of the new product is imperfectly known, but common 
 to all buyers (common values) as well as the case where the quality 
 is different across buyers (private values). 
  
 We distinguish between new products that are improvements to existing 
 products and new products that are substitutes. Different types of 
 products have qualitatively distinct diffusion paths. Improvements are 
 introduced slowly relative to the full information case, while 
 substitutes are introduced more aggressively. The slow entry strategy 
 is associated with increasing supply and decreasing prices over time. 
 The reverse pattern holds for an aggressive entry strategy 
  
 The incentives to innovate display a similar distinction. A firm with 
 a currently inferior product opts for a large but risky innovation, 
 whereas a currently superior producer chooses a smaller but certain 
 innovation.

Title: Conditioning Institutions and Renegotiation 
Abstract: We propose a theory of contracting in long-term relationships,
 emphasizing the role of social institutions in conditioning players'
 joint selection of Equilibria. Players adopt a social conditioning
 system in order to place boundaries on their recurrent negotiation and
 thereby sustain a desirable joint selection of equilibrium. Social
 conventions have value because players cannot freely reinterpret the
 labels attached to histories, in contrast to labels that the players
 might assign internally. We present examples of social conventions that
 are useful for sustaining cooperative interaction. Our model combines
 an explicit bargaining technology with a renegotiation concept, coherent
 equilibrium, that builds on internal consistency. Coherent equilibria
 exist in general and, for an important class of games, induce unique
 outcomes.

Title: Estimation of Autoregressive Roots Near Unity Using Panel Data 
Abstract: Time series data are often well modelled by using the device 
 of an autoregressive root that is local to unity. Unfortunately, the 
 localizing parameter (c) is not consistently estimable using existing 
 time series econometric techniques and the lack of a consistent 
 estimator complicates inference. This paper develops procedures for 
 the estimation of a common localizing parameter using panel data. 
 Pooling information across individuals in a panel aids the 
 identification and estimation of the localising parameter and leads 
 to consistent estimation in simple panel models. However, in the 
 important case of models with concomitant deterministic trends, it 
 is shown that pooled panel estimators of the localising parameter are 
 asymptotically biased. Some techniques are developed to overcome this 
 difficulty and consistent estimators of c in the region c < 0 are 
 developed for panel models with deterministic and stochastic trends. 
 A limit distribution theory is also established and test statistics 
 are constructed for exploring interesting hypotheses, like the 
 equivalence of local to unity parameters across subgroups of the 
 population. The methods are applied to the empirically important 
 problem of the efficient extraction of deterministic trends. They are 
 also shown to deliver consistent estimates of distancing parameters 
 in nonstationary panel models where the initial conditions are in the 
 distant past.

Title: Nonstationary Binary Choice 
Abstract: This paper develops an asymptotic theory for time series 
 binary choice models with nonstationary explanatory variables 
 generated as integrated processes. Both logit and probit models are 
 covered. The maximum likelihood (ML) estimator is consistent but a 
 new phenomenon arises in its limit distribution theory. The estimator 
 consists of a mixture of two components, one of which is parallel to 
 and the other orthogonal to the direction of the true parameter 
 vector, with the latter being the principal component. The ML
 estimator is shown to converge at a rate of n^{3/4} along its 
 principal component but has the slower rate of n^{1/4} convergence in 
 all other directions. This is the first instance known to the authors 
 of multiple convergence rates in models where the regressors have the 
 same (full rank) stochastic order and where the parameters appear in 
 linear forms of these regressors. It is a consequence of the fact 
 that the estimating equations involve nonlinear integrable 
 transformations of linear forms of integrated processes as well as 
 polynomials in these processes, and the asymptotic behavior of these 
 elements are quite different. The limit distribution of the ML 
 estimator is derived and is shown to be a mixture of two mixed normal 
 distributions with mixing variates that are dependent upon Brownian 
 local time as well as Brownian motion. 
  
 It is further shown that the sample proportion of binary choices 
 follows an arc sine law and therefore spends most of its time in the 
 neighbourhood of zero or unity. The result has implications for 
 policy decision making that involves binary choices and where the 
 decisions depend on economic fundamentals that involve stochastic 
 trends. Our limit theory shows that, in such conditions, policy is 
 likely to manifest streams of little intervention or intensive 
 intervention.

Title: Linear Regression Limit Theory for Nonstationary Panel Data 
Abstract: This paper develops a regression limit theory for 
 nonstationary panel data with large numbers of cross section (n) and 
 time series (T) observations. The limit theory allows for both 
 sequential limits, wherein T -> infinity followed by n -> infinity, 
 and joint limits where T, n -> infinity simultaneously; and the 
 relationship between these multidimensional limits is explored. The 
 panel structures considered allow for no time series cointegration, 
 heterogeneous cointegration, homogeneous cointegration, and 
 near-homogeneous cointegration. The paper explores the existence of 
 long-run average relations between integrated panel vectors when 
 there is no individual time series cointegration and when there is 
 heterogeneous cointegration. These relations are parametrized in 
 terms of the matrix regression coefficient of the long-run average 
 covariance matrix. In the case of homogeneous and near homogeneous 
 cointegrating panels, a panel fully modified regression estimator is 
 developed and studied. The limit theory enables us to test hypotheses 
 about the long run average parameters both within and between
 subgroups of the full population.

Title: Nonstationary Panel Data Analysis: An Overview of Some Recent 
 Developments 
Abstract: This paper overviews some recent developments in panel data 
 asymptotics, concentrating on the nonstationary panel case and gives 
 a new result for models with individual effects. Underlying recent 
 theory are asymptotics for multi-indexed processes in which both 
 indexes may pass to infinity. We review some of the new limit theory 
 that has been developed, show how it can be applied and give a new 
 interpretation of individual effects in nonstationary panel data. 
 Fundamental to the interpretation of much of the asymptotics is the 
 concept of a panel regression coefficient which measures the long run 
 average relation across a section of the panel. This concept is 
 analogous to the statistical interpretation of the coefficient in a 
 classical regression relation. A variety of nonstationary panel data 
 models are discussed and the paper reviews the asymptotic properties 
 of estimators in these various models. Some recent developments in 
 panel unit root tests and stationary dynamic panel regression models 
 are also reviewed.

Title: Empirical Limits for Time Series Econometric Models 
Abstract: This paper seeks to characterize empirically achievable 
 limits for time series econometric modeling. The approach involves 
 the concept of minimal information loss in time series regression and 
 the paper shows how to derive bounds that delimit the proximity of 
 empirical measures to the true probability measure in models that are 
 of econometric interest. The approach utilizes generally valid 
 asymptotic expressions for Bayesian data densities and works from 
 joint measures over the sample space and parameter space. A theorem 
 due to Rissanen is modified so that it applies directly to 
 probabilities about the relative likelihood (rather than averages), 
 a new way  of proving results of the Rissanen type is demonstrated, 
 and the Rissanen theory is extended to nonstationary time series with 
 unit roots, near unit roots and cointegration of unknown order. The 
 corresponding bound for the minimal information loss in empirical 
 work is shown not to be a constant, in general, but to be proportional 
 to the logarithm of the determinant of the (possibility stochastic) 
 Fisher-information matrix. In fact, the bound that determines 
 proximity to the DGP is generally path dependent, and it depends 
 specifically on the type as well as the number of regressors. Time 
 trends are more costly than stochastic trends, which, in turn, are 
 more costly than stationary regressors in achieving proximity to the 
 true density. The conclusion is that, in a very real sense, the 'true' 
 DGP is more elusive when there is nonstationarity in the data. Some 
 implications of these results for prediction and for the achieving 
 proximity to the optimal predictor are explored.

Title: Descriptive Econometrics for Nonstationary Time Series with 
 Empirical Illustrations 
Abstract: Recent work by the author on methods of spatial density 
 analysis for time series data with stochastic trends is reviewed and 
 extended. The methods are illustrated in some empirical applications 
 and simulations. The empirical applications include macroeconomic data 
 on inflation, financial data on exchange rates and political opinion 
 poll data. It is shown how the methods can be used to measure 
 empirical hazard rates for inflation and deflation. Empirical 
 estimates based on historical US data over the last 60 years indicate 
 that the predominant inflation risks are at low levels (2-6%) and 
 low two-digit levels (10-12%), and that there is also a significant 
 risk of deflation around the -1% level.

Title: Starting Small in an Unfamiliar Environment 
Abstract: Motivated by a characteristic way in which firms in 
 developed countries make their decisions regarding cooperation with 
 potential partners from less developed countries, we design a simple 
 model of a DC firm's search for an LDC partner/supplier and the 
 subsequent relationship between the two parties. Matched firms can 
 "start small" with a trial order or pilot project of variable size 
 in order to gain information about the ability of the LDC firm to 
 successfully carry out a large project. We derive results relating 
 whether and how the parties start small to the characteristics of 
 the large project and to the matching environment. Among other 
 results, we show how risk and search cost are associated with the 
 propensity to start small and we establish a connection between 
 starting small and the expected longevity of successful partnerships. 
 We also address methods of contract enforcement and demonstrate the 
 relationship between starting small and monitoring.

Title: Starting Small and Commitment 
Abstract: I study a model of a long-term partnership with two-sided 
 incomplete information. The partners jointly determine the stakes of 
 their relationship and individually decide whether to cooperate with 
 or betray each other over time. I characterize the extremal -- 
 interim incentive efficient equilibria. In these equilibria, the 
 partners generally "start small," with the level of interaction 
 growing over time. The types of players separate quickly. Further, 
 cooperation between "good" types is viable regardless of how 
 pessimistic the players are about each other initially. The quick 
 nature of separation in an extremal equilibrium contrasts with the 
 outcome selected by a strong renegotiation criterion (as studied in 
 Watson [11]).

Title: Contract-Theoretic Approaches to Wages and Displacement 
Abstract: This paper develops a theoretical framework for analyzing  
 contracting imperfections in long-term employment relationships. We 
 focus chiefly on limited enforceability and limited worker liquidity. 
 Inefficient severance of employment relationships, payment of 
 efficiency wages, the relative responses of wages and employment to 
 business cycle shocks, and the propagation of these shocks are linked 
 to the nature of contracting imperfections.

Title: Liquidity Flows and Fragility of Business Enterprises 
Abstract: This paper considers the efficiency of financial 
 intermediation and the propagation of business cycle shocks in a 
 model of long-term relationships between entrepreneurs and lenders, 
 where lenders may be constrained in their short-run access to 
 liquidity. When liquidity is low, relationships are subject to 
 breakups that lead to loss of joint surplus. Liquidity outflows 
 cause damage to financial structure by breaking up relationships, 
 and damage persists due to frictions in the formation of new 
 relationships. Feedbacks between aggregate investment and the 
 structure of intermediation greatly magnify the effects of shocks. 
 For large shocks, financial collapse may become inescapable in the 
 absence of external intervention.

Title: Experimentation in Markets 
Abstract: We present a model of entry and exit with Bayesian learning 
 and price competition. A new product of initially unknown quality is 
 introduced in the market, and purchases of the product yield 
 information on its true quality. We assume that the performance of 
 the new product is publicly observable. As agents learn from the 
 experiments of others, informational externalities arise.
  
 We determine the Markov Perfect Equilibrium prices and allocations. 
 In a single market, the combination of the informational externalities 
 among the buyers and the strategic pricing by the sellers results in 
 excessive experimentation. If the new product is launched in many 
 distinct markets, the path of sales converges to the efficient path 
 in the limit as the number of markets grows.

Title: The Hierarchical Approach to Modeling Knowledge and Common 
 Knowledge 
Abstract: One approach to representing knowledge or belief of agents, 
 used by economists and computer scientists, involves an infinite 
 hierarchy of beliefs. Such a hierarchy consists of an agent's beliefs 
 about the state of the world, his beliefs about other agents' beliefs 
 about the world, his beliefs about other agents' beliefs about other 
 agents' beliefs about the world, and so on. (Economists have typically 
 modeled belief in terms of a probability distribution on the 
 uncertainty space. In contrast, computer scientists have modeled 
 belief in terms of a set of worlds, intuitively, the ones the agent 
 considers possible.) We consider the question of when a countably 
 infinite hierarchy completely describes the uncertainty of the agents. 
 We provide various necessary and sufficient conditions for this 
 property. It turns out that the probability-based approach can be 
 viewed as satisfying one of these conditions, which explains why a 
 countable hierarchy suffices in this case. These conditions also show 
 that whether a countable hierarchy suffices may depend on the 
 "richness" of the states in the underlying state space. We also 
 consider the question of whether a countable hierarchy suffices for 
 "interesting" sets of events, and show that the answer depends on the 
 definition of "interesting."

Title: Measuring Bubble Expectations and Investor Confidence 
Abstract: This paper presents evidence on attitude changes among 
 investors in the US stock market. Two basic attitudes are explored: 
 bubble expectations and investor confidence. Semiannual time-series 
 indicators of these attitudes are presented for US stock market 
 institutional investors based on questionnaire survey results 
 1989-1998, from surveys that I have derived in collaboration with 
 Fumiko Kon-Ya and Yoshiro Tsutsui. 
  
 Five different time-series indicators whether there is among investors 
 an expectation of a speculative bubble, an unstable situation with 
 expectations for increase in the short run only, are produced. Four 
 different time-series indicators whether there is an expectation of 
 a negative speculative bubble are presented. Four different
 time-series indicators of investor confidence, that nothing can go 
 wrong, are produced. 
  
 Time-series variation for these indicators is significant, and cross 
 correlations are generally positive. A bubble expectations index, a 
 negative-bubble expectations index, and an investor confidence index 
 are derived from these indicators. 
  
 Behavior of the indicators and indexes through time is examined, 
 and the indexes are compared with other economic variables. A 
 notable finding is a degree of high-frequency fluctuation, semester 
 to semester, in the indexes.

Title: Pareto Improving Price Regulation When the Asset Market Is 
 Incomplete 
Abstract: When the asset market is incomplete, competitive equilibria 
 are constrained suboptimal, which provides a scope for pareto 
 improving interventions. Price regulation can be such a pareto 
 improving policy, even when the welfare effects of rationing are 
 taken into account. An appealing aspect of price regulation is that 
 it that it operates anonymously on market variables.
  
 Fix-price equilibria exist under weak assumptions. Such equilibria 
 permit a competitive analysis of an economy with an incomplete asset 
 market that is out of equilibrium. Arbitrage opportunities may 
 arise: with three or more assets actively traded, an individual 
 may hold an arbitrage portfolio at equilibrium.
  
 The local existence of fix-price equilibrium for prices that are 
 almost competitive may fail for robust examples. Under necessary 
 and sufficient conditions for the local existence of fix-price 
 equilibria, Pareto improving price regulation is generically possible.

Title: Preference for Information and Dynamic Consistency 
Abstract: We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a 
 dynamically consistent agent always to prefer more informative signals
 (in single-agent problems). These conditions do not imply recursivity,
 reduction or independence. We provide a simple definition of
 dynamically consistent behavior, and we discuss whether an intrinsic
 information lover (say, an anxious person) is likely to be dynamically
 consistent.

Title: Decomposable Choice Under Uncertainty 
Abstract: Savage motivated his Sure Thing Principle by arguing that, 
 whenever an act would be preferred if an event obtains and preferred 
 if that event did not obtain, then it should be preferred overall. 
 The idea that it should be possible to decompose and recompose 
 decision problems in this way has normative appeal. We show, however, 
 that it does not require the full separability across events implicit 
 in Savage's axiom. We formulate a weaker axiom that suffices for 
 decomposability, and show that this implies an implicit additive 
 representation. Our decomposability property makes local necessary 
 conditions for optimality, globally sufficient. Thus, it is useful 
 in computing optimal acts. It also enables Nash behavior in games of 
 incomplete information to be decentralized to the agent-normal form. 
 None of these results rely on probabilistic sophistication; indeed, 
 our axiom is consistent with the Ellsberg paradox. If we assume 
 probabilistic sophistication, however, then the axiom holds if and 
 only if the agent's induced preferences over lotteries satisfy 
 betweenness.

Title: Dynamic Common Agency 
Abstract: We consider a general model of dynamic common agency with 
 symmetric information. We focus on Markov perfect equilibria and 
 characterize the equilibrium set for a refinement of the Markov 
 perfect equilibria. Particular attention is given to the existence 
 of a marginal contribution equilibrium where each principal receives 
 her contribution to the coalition of agent and remaining principals. 
 The structure of the intertemporal payoffs is analyzed in terms of 
 the flow marginal contribution. As a byproduct, new results for the 
 static common agency game are obtained.
  
 The general characterization results are then applied to two dynamic 
 bidding games for a common agent: (i) multi-task allocation and (ii) 
 job matching under uncertainty.

Title: Estimating Yield Curves by Kernel Smoothing Methods 
Abstract: We introduce a new method for the estimation of discount 
 functions, yield curves and forward curves for coupon bonds. Our 
 approach is nonparametric and does not assume a particular functional 
 form for the discount function although we do show how to impose 
 various important restrictions in the estimation. Our method is based 
 on kernel smoothing and is defined as the minimum of some localized 
 population moment condition. The solution to the sample problem is 
 not explicit and our estimation procedure is iterative, rather like 
 the backfitting method of estimating additive nonparametric models. 
 We establish the asymptotic normality of our methods using the 
 asymptotic representation of our estimator as an infinite series 
 with declining coefficients. The rate of convergence is standard 
 for one dimensional nonparametric regression.

Title: A Theory of the Onset of Currency Attacks 
Abstract: The swiftness and devastating impact of recent financial 
 crises have taken many market participants by surprise, and pose 
 challenges for economists seeking a theory of the onset of a crisis. 
 We propose such a theory based on two features. The actions of 
 diverse economic actors which undermine the currency are mutually 
 reinforcing, while the fragmented nature of the media create small 
 disparities in their information. In such circumstances, the beliefs 
 of market participants can be tracked in the same way as the economic 
 fundamentals, and an attack is triggered when the economic 
 fundamentals deteriorate sufficiently to fall below the minimum level 
 of market confidence necessary to support the currency. We give a 
 characterization of such a minimum level of confidence.

Title: Fiat Money and the Efficient Financing of the Float, 
 Production and Consumption. Part I: The Float 
Abstract: The basic distinction in the optimization conditions between 
 the general equilibrium model of a T period exchange economy and a 
 strategic market game process model is between a set of equations 
 homogeneous of order zero and a set of nonhomogeneous equations. The 
 latter have an amount M of outside or fiat money added to the system. 
 If there is an outside bank willing to lend or accept deposits at an 
 interest rate rho > 0 at the end of time T the initial amount of money 
 M will have been consumed in interest payments to the outside bank. 
 The price level is fully determined and in an economy where all assets 
 are traded, the float is financed efficiently, otherwise there is a 
 price wedge between buying and selling prices.

Title: Requiem for Kyoto: An Economic Analysis of the Kyoto Protocol 
Abstract: This paper uses the newly developed RICE-98 model to analyze 
 the economics of the Kyoto Protocol. It analyzes versions of the 
 Kyoto Protocol that have different approaches to trading emissions 
 rights and compares these with efficient approaches. The major 
 conclusions are: (a) the global cost of the Kyoto Protocol is $716 
 billion in present value, (b) the United States bears almost 
 two-thirds of the global cost; and (c) the benefit-cost ratio of the 
 Kyoto Protocol is 1/7. Additionally, the emissions strategy is highly 
 cost-ineffective, with the global temperature reduction achieved at 
 a cost almost 8 times the cost of a strategy which is cost-effective 
 in terms of "where" and "when" efficiency.

Title: The Health of Nations: Irving Fisher and the Contribution of 
 Improved Longevity to Living Standards 
Abstract: Among Irving Fisher's many contributions to economics, one 
 that is little noted and barely remembered is his emphasis on the 
 economic importance of health. For the most part, his concern was in 
 promoting healthy life styles. In addition, he made an early (perhaps 
 the earliest) estimate of the impact of mortality and morbidity on 
 national output.

Title: Price Competition for an Informed Buyer 
Abstract: We investigate the outcomes of simultaneous price competition
 in the presence of private information on the demand side. Each of two
 sellers offers a different variety of a good to a buyer endowed with a
 private binary signal on their relative quality. We analyze how the
 unique equilibrium of the game changes as a function of the (common)
 prior belief on the relative quality of the goods and the precision of
 the private information of the buyer. Competition is fierce, and the
 buyer enjoys high rents, when the prior belief is biased in favor of
 one good and private signals are not very informative: the ex ante
 superior seller cannot resist the temptation to clear the market, and
 triggers an aggressive response by the competitor. When instead the
 distribution of ex post valuations is highly spread, due to a vague
 prior belief and strong signals, the sellers become local monopolists
 and extract high rents from the buyer. We provide a full
 characterization of the mixed-strategy equilibrium which arises when
 the two goods are mildly differentiated ex post. Overall, the
 market-clearing temptation effect destroys the monotonicity and
 convexity of the equilibrium profit of a seller in the prior belief.
 As a consequence, a competing seller does not necessarily benefit from
 revelation of public information, sometimes even if biased in its favor. 
  
 This paper analyzes the behavior of posterior distributions under the
 Jeffreys prior in a simultaneous equations model. The case under study
 is that of a general limited information setup with n + 1 endogenous
 variables. The Jeffreys prior is shown to give rise to a marginal
 posterior density which has Cauchy-like tails similar to that
 exhibited by the exact finite sample distribution of the corresponding
 LIML estimator. A stronger correspondence is established in the special
 case of a just-identified orthonormal canonical model, where the
 posterior density under the Jeffreys prior is shown to have the same
 functional form as the density of the finite sample distribution of
 the LIML estimator. The work here generalizes that of Chao and Phillips
 (1997), which gives analogous results for the special case of two
 endogenous variables.

Title: Rissanen's Theorem and Econometric Time Series 
Abstract: In a typical empirical modeling context, the data generating 
 process (DGP) of a time series is assumed to be known up to a 
 finite-dimensional parameter. In such cases, Rissanen's (1986) theorem 
 provides a lower bound for the empirically achievable distance between 
 all possible data-based models and the true DGP. This distance depends 
 only on the dimension of the parameter space. The present paper 
 examines the empirical relevance of this notion to econometric time 
 series and discusses a new version of the theorem that allows for 
 nonstationary DGP's. Nonstationarity is relevant in many economic 
 applications and it is shown that the form of nonstationarity affects, 
 and indeed increases, the empirically achievable distance to the true 
 DGP.

Title: New Unit Root Asymptotics in the Presence of Deterministic 
 Trends 
Abstract: Recent work by the author (1998) has shown that stochastic 
 trends can be validly represented in empirical regressions in terms 
 of deterministic functions of time. These representations offer an 
 alternative mechanism for modelling stochastic trends. It is shown 
 here that the alternate representations affect the asymptotics of 
 all commonly used unit root tests in the presence of trends. In 
 particular, the critical values of unit root tests diverge when the 
 number of deterministic regressors K approaches infinity as the 
 sample size n approaches infinity. In such circumstances, use of 
 conventional critical values based on fixed K will lead to rejection 
 of the null of a unit root in favour of trend stationarity with 
 probability one when the null is true. The results can be interpreted 
 as saying that serious attempts to model trends by deterministic 
 functions will always be successful and that these functions can 
 validly represent stochastically trending data even when lagged 
 variables are present in the regressor set, thereby undermining 
 conventional unit root tests.

Title: Finance Applications of Game Theory 
Abstract: Traditional finance theory based on the assumptions of 
 symmetric information and perfect and competitive markets has 
 provided many important insights. These include the Modigliani 
 and Miller Theorems, the CAPM, the Efficient Markets Hypothesis 
 and continuous time finance. However, many empirical phenomena are 
 difficult to reconcile with this traditional framework. Game 
 theoretic techniques have allowed insights into a number of these. 
 Many puzzles remain. This paper argues that recent advances in game 
 theory concerned with higher order beliefs, informational cascades 
 and heterogeneous prior beliefs have the potential to provide 
 insights into some of these remaining puzzles.

Title: Would a Privatized Social Security System Really Pay a Higher 
 Rate of Return? 
Abstract: Many advocates of social security privatization argue that 
 rates of return under a defined contribution individual account system 
 would be much higher for all than they are under the current social 
 security system. This claim is false. The mistake comes from ignoring 
 accrued benefits already promised based on past payroll taxes, and 
 from underestimating the riskiness of stock investments. 
  
 Confusion arises because three distinct reforms are muddled. By 
 privatization we mean creating individual accounts (which could, for 
 example, be invested exclusively in bonds). By diversification we mean 
 investing in stocks, and perhaps other assets, as well as bonds; 
 diversification might be undertaken either by individuals in their 
 private social security accounts, or by the social security trust 
 fund. By prefunding we mean closing the gap between social security 
 benefits promised to date and the assets on hand to pay for them. 
 Any one of these reforms could be implemented without the other two. 
  
 If the system were completely privatized, with no prefunding or 
 diversification, the social security system would need to raise taxes 
 and/or issue new debt in order to pay benefits already accrued. If 
 the burden were spread evenly across all future generations via a 
 constant proportional tax, the added taxes would completely eliminate 
 any rate of return advantage on the individual accounts. We estimate 
 that the required new taxes would amount to about 3 percent of 
 payroll, or about a quarter of all social security contributions, in 
 perpetuity. Unlike privatization, prefunding would raise rates of 
 return for later generations, but at the cost of lower returns for 
 today's workers. 
  
 For households able to invest in the stock market on their own, 
 diversification would not raise rates of return, correctly adjusted 
 to recognize risk. Households that are constrained from holding stock, 
 due to lack of wealth outside of social security or to fixed costs 
 from holding stocks, would gain higher risk-adjusted returns and would 
 benefit from diversification. If this group is large, diversification 
 would raise stock values, thus helping current stockholders, but it 
 would lower future stock returns, thus hurting young unconstrained 
 households. Overall, since the number of truly constrained household 
 is probably not that large, privatization and diversification would 
 have a much smaller effect on returns than reformers typically claim.

Title: Social Security Money's Worth 
Abstract: This paper describes how three money's worth measures -- the 
 benefit-to-tax ratio, the internal rate of return, and the net present 
 value -- are calculated and used in analyses of social security 
 reforms, including systems with privately managed individual accounts 
 invested in equities. Declining returns from the U.S. social security 
 system prove to be the inevitable result of having instituted an 
 unfunded (pay-as-you-go) retirement system that delivered $7.9 
 trillion of net transfers (in 1997 present value dollars) to people 
 born before 1917, and will deliver another $1.8 trillion to people 
 born between 1918 and 1937. But young and future workers cannot 
 necessarily do better by investing their payroll taxes in capital 
 markets. If the old system were closed down, massive unfunded 
 liabilities of $9-10 trillion would still have to be paid unless 
 already accrued benefits were cut. Alternative methods of calculating 
 these accrued benefits yield somewhat different numbers: the straight 
 line calculation is $800 billion less than the constant benefit 
 calculation we propose as the benchmark. Using this benchmark in a 
 world with no uncertainty, we show that privatization without 
 prefunding would not increase returns at all, net of the new taxes 
 needed to pay for unfunded liabilities. These new taxes would amount 
 to 3.6 percent of payroll, or about 29 percent of social security 
 contributions. Prefunding implemented by reducing accrued benefits 
 or by raising taxes, would eventually increase money's worth for 
 later generations, but at the cost of lower money's worth for today's 
 workers and/or retirees. 
  
 Computing money's worth when there is uncertainty is much more 
 difficult unless four conditions hold, namely optimization, time 
 homogeneity, stable prices, and spanning. Under these conditions, 
 the diversification of social security investments into stocks and 
 out of bonds has no effect whatsoever on money's worth when it is 
 properly adjusted for risk: a dollar of stock is worth no more than 
 a dollar of bonds. When spanning fails, diversification can raise 
 welfare for constrained households, but the exact money's worth must 
 depend on specific assumptions about household attitudes toward risk. 
 Calculations like those of the Social Security Advisory Council that 
 attribute over $2.85 of net present value gain to each $1 shifted 
 from bonds to stocks completely overlook the disutility of risk. By 
 contrast, we estimate that a 2 percent of payroll equity fund carved 
 out of social security would increase net present value by about 59 
 cents per dollar of bonds switched into equities, instead of $2.85. 
 When the likely reductions in income and longevity insurance are 
 factored in, the net advantage of privatization and diversification 
 is substantially less than popularly perceived.

Title: Higher Order Approximations for Wald Statistics in 
 Cointegrating Regressions 
Abstract: Asymptotic expansions are developed for Wald test statistics 
 in cointegrating regression models. These expansions provide an 
 opportunity to reduce size distortion in testing by suitable 
 bandwidth selection, and automated rules for doing so are calculated. 
 Band spectral regression methods and tests are also considered. In 
 such cases, it is shown how the effects of nonstationarity that 
 dominate low frequency limit behaviour also carry over to high 
 frequency asymptotics, with consequential effects on bandwidth rules.

Title: How to Estimate Autoregressive Roots Near Unity 
Abstract: A new model of near integration is formulated in which the 
 local to unity parameter is identifiable and consistently estimable 
 with time series data. The properties of the model are investigated, 
 new functional laws for near integrated time series are obtained, 
 and consistent estimators of the localizing parameter are constructed. 
 The model provides a more complete interface between I(0) and I(1) 
 models than the traditional local to unity model and leads to 
 autoregressive coefficient estimates with rates of convergence that 
 vary continuously between the O(/n) rate of stationary autoregression, 
 the O(n) rate of unit root regression and the power rate of explosive 
 autoregression. Models with deterministic trends are also considered, 
 least squares trend regression is shown to be efficient, and 
 consistent estimates of the localising parameter are obtained for 
 this case as well. Conventional unit root tests are shown to be 
 consistent against local alternatives in the new class.

Title: Nonlinear Regressions with Integrated Time Series 
Abstract: An asymptotic theory is developed for nonlinear regression 
 with integrated processes. The models allow for nonlinear effects 
 from unit root time series and therefore deal with the case of 
 parametric nonlinear cointegration. The theory covers integrable, 
 asymptotically homogeneous and explosive functions. Sufficient 
 conditions for weak consistency are given and a limit distribution 
 theory is provided. In general, the limit theory is mixed normal 
 with mixing variates that depend on the sojourn time of the limiting

Title: A Primer on Unit Root Testing 
Abstract: The immense literature and diversity of unit root tests can 
 at times be confusing even to the specialist and presents a truly 
 daunting prospect to the uninitiated. In consequence, much empirical 
 work still makes use of the simplest testing procedures because it is 
 unclear from the literature and from recent reviews which tests if 
 any are superior. This paper presents a survey of unit root theory 
 with an emphasis on testing principles and recent developments. The 
 general framework adopted makes it possible to consider tests of 
 stochastic trends against trend stationarity and trend breaks of a 
 general type. The main tests are listed, and asymptotic distributions 
 are given in a simple form that emphasizes commonalities in the 
 theory. Some simulation results are reported, and an extensive list 
 of references and an annotated bibliography are provided.

Title: Financial Globalization: Can National Currencies Survive? 
Abstract: Fixed exchange rate, pegs to hard currencies that can be 
 adjusted, are fragile, the more so the more mobile are capital funds 
 across currencies and national markets. Once market participants doubt, 
 for whatever reason, the ability of a developing or emerging economy's 
 central bank to meet its commitment to redeem it currency in hard 
 currency at the promised rate, they will race to claim the country's 
 external reserves. Vulnerability to crises becomes greater as 
 financial markets become less regulated and more internationally open. 
 To escape currency crises, a country may lock its money to that of a 
 reserve-currency country, as by a "currency board." This may, if an 
 only if reserves are ample and all other economic objectives are 
 subordinated, maintain the peg and hold down inflation. But it 
 sacrifices monetary autonomy and seignorage, leading in effect and 
 perhaps literally to substitution of the reserve currency for the 
 local currency as unit of account and means of payment.
  
 When crises hit, the IMF and other lenders give highest priority to 
 restoration of credibility and confidence in the currency under 
 attack. They require the victim country to take drastic restrictive 
 monetary and fiscal measures, whether or not irresponsibility in 
 these policies brought on the crisis. Since these measures damage 
 the economy, businesses, and banks, they may not restore confidence. 
 Lenders of last resort are essential and should concentrate above all 
 on replenishing liquidity.
  
 The adjustable-peg system has outlived its usefulness. For most 
 countries it is better to let exchange rates float in markets, like 
 those of the big three currencies, dollar, yen, and deutsche mark 
 (or euro). Even so, unimpeded inflows and outflows of liquid funds 
 result in unwelcome exchange rate movements. Protection against them, 
 by taxes or special reserve requirements, are desirable, and need not 
 curtail useful capital flows. Banks and businesses need to be 
 prevented from incurring net short term debt positions in hard 
 currency. Equity and direct fixed capital are the desirable vehicles 
 for developmental capital movements.

Title: Monetary Policy: Recent Theory and Practice 
Abstract: The paper reviews the major developments of the last three 
 decades: the rise and fall of monetarism as theory and as targeting 
 of intermediate monetary aggregates; targeting of nominal GDP in 
 order to escape volatility of velocity of money; the abandonment of 
 intermediate targets as superfluous; the use of money-market interest 
 rates as operating procedure, except in the U.S.; their replacement 
 by reserve aggregates in 1970-82; inflation stability and price level 
 stability as policy objectives, often exclusive of other macroeconomic 
 goals; the U.S. Federal Reserve as aiming successfully at both low 
 inflation and low unemployment, goals mandated by law; the 
 rules-discretion debate; the necessity for rules conditional on 
 economic states and the impossibility of anticipating all 
 circumstances, thus the inevitability of discretion but in the spirit 
 of rules; John Taylor's algebraic rule for the Federal Reserve, 
 relating Federal Funds rate to inflation and unemployment deviation 
 from goals.

Title: Nonparametric Censored Regression 
Abstract: The nonparametric censored regression model is y = 
 max[c, m(x) + e], where both the regression function m(x) and the 
 distribution of the error e are unknown, but the fixed censoring 
 point c is known. This paper provides a simple consistent estimator 
 of the derivative of m(x) with respect to each element of x. The 
 convergence rate of this estimator is the same as for the derivatives 
 of an uncensored nonparametric regression. We then estimate the 
 regression function itself by solving the associated partial 
 differential equation system. We show that our estimator of m(x) 
 achieves the same rate of convergence as the usual estimators in 
 uncensored nonparametric regression. We also provide root n estimates 
 of weighted average derivatives of m(x), which equal the coefficients 
 in any linear or partly linear specification for m(x).

Title: Social Security and Institutions for Intergenerational, 
 Intragenerational and International Risk Sharing 
Abstract: Social security system old age insurance systems are devices 
 for the sharing of income risks of elderly people with others. Risks 
 can be shared intergenerationally (with the young of the same 
 country), intragenerationally (with other elderly of the same country) 
 or internationally (with foreigners). 
  
 Barriers to individuals themselves sharing their risks 
 intergenerationally, intragenerationally or internationally are 
 described. Optimal design of government-sponsored social security 
 systems is considered in light of these barriers. 
  
 Alternative benefits and contributions formulas for pay-as-you-go 
 social security systems are defined and compared with existing and 
 proposed formulas in terms of their ability to fulfill the 
 government's role in promoting risk sharing. Benefits for each retired 
 person may be tied to that person's lifetime income without causing 
 (as with the US benefits formula today) aggregate benefits for all 
 elderly today to be tied to their past aggregate income.

Title: A Strategic Market Game with Active Bankruptcy 
Abstract: We construct stationary Markov equilibria for an economy with 
 fiat money, one non-durable commodity, countably-many time periods, 
 and a continuum of agents. The total production of commodity remains 
 constant, but individual agents' endowments fluctuate in a random 
 fashion, from period to period. In order to hedge against these random 
 fluctuations, agents find it useful to hold fiat money which they can 
 borrow or deposit at appropriate rates of interest; such activity may 
 take place either at a central bank (which fixes interest rates 
 judiciously) or through a money-market (in which interest rates are 
 determined endogenously). 
  
 We carry out an equilibrium analysis, based on a careful study of 
 Dynamic Programming equations and on properties of the Invariant 
 Measures for associated optimally-controlled Markov chains. This 
 analysis yields the stationary distribution of wealth across agents, 
 as well as the stationary price (for the commodity) and interest rates 
 (for the borrowing and lending of fiat money). 
  
 A distinctive feature of our analysis is the incorporation of 
 bankruptcy, both as a real possibility in an individual agent's 
 optimization problem, as well as a determinant of interest rates 
 through appropriate balance equations. These allow a central bank 
 (respectively, a money-market) to announce (respectively, to determine 
 endogenously) interest rates in a way that conserves the total 
 money-supply and controls inflation. 
  
 General results are provided for the existence of such stationary 
 equilibria, and several explicitly solvable examples are treated in 
 detail.

Title: Asymptotics for Nonlinear Transformations of Integrated Time 
 Series 
Abstract: An asymptotic theory for stochastic processes generated from 
 nonlinear transformations of nonstationary integrated time series is 
 developed. Various nonlinear functions of integrated series such as 
 ARIMA time series are studied, and the asymptotic distributions of 
 sample moments of such functions are obtained and analyzed. The 
 transformations considered in the paper include a variety of functions 
 that are used in practical nonlinear statistical analysis. It is shown 
 that their asymptotic theory is quite different from that of 
 integrated processes and stationary time series. When the 
 transformation function is exponentially explosive, for instance, the 
 convergence rate of sample functions is path-dependent. In particular, 
 the convergence rate depends not only on the size of the sample, but 
 also on the realized sample path. Some brief applications of these 
 asymptotics are given to illustrate the effects of nonlinearly 
 transformed integrated processes on regression. The methods developed 
 in the paper are useful in a project of greater scope concerned with 
 the development of a general theory of nonlinear regression for 
 nonstationary time series.

Title: Nonstationary Density Estimation and Kernel Autoregression 
Abstract: An asymptotic theory is developed for the kernel density 
 estimate of a random walk and the kernel regression estimator of a 
 nonstationary first order autoregression. The kernel density estimator 
 provides a consistent estimate of the local time spent by the random 
 walk in the spatial vicinity of a point that is determined in part by 
 the argument of the density and in part by initial conditions. The 
 kernel regression estimator is shown to be consistent and to have a 
 mixed normal limit theory. The limit distribution has a mixing variate 
 that is given by the reciprocal of the local time of a standard 
 Brownian motion. The permissible range for the bandwidth parameter 
 h_{n} includes rates which may increase as well as decrease with the 
 sample size n, in contrast to the case of a stationary autoregression. 
 However, the convergence rate of the kernel regression estimator is at 
 most n^{1/4}, and this is slower than that of a stationary kernel 
 autoregression, in contrast to the parametric case. In spite of these 
 differences in the limit theory and the rates of convergence between 
 the stationary and nonstationary cases, it is shown that the usual 
 formulae for confidence intervals for the regression function still 
 apply when h_{n} -> 0.

Title: Econometric Analysis of Fisher's Equation 
Abstract: Fisher's equation for the determination of the real rate of 
 interest is studied from a fresh econometric perspective. Some new 
 methods of data description for nonstationary time series are 
 introduced. The methods provide a nonparametric mechanism for 
 modelling the spatial densities of a time series that displays random 
 wandering characteristics, like interest rates and inflation. Hazard 
 rate functionals are also constructed, an asymptotic theory is given 
 and the techniques are illustrated in some empirical applications to 
 real interest rates for the US. The paper ends by calculating 
 Gaussian semiparametric estimates of long range dependence in US real 
 interest rates, using a new asymptotic theory that covers the 
 nonstationary case. The empirical results indicate that the real rate 
 of interest in the US is (fractionally) nonstationary over 1934-1997 
 and over the more recent subperiods 1961-1985 and 1961-1997. Unit 
 root nonstationarity and short memory stationarity are both strongly 
 rejected for all these periods.

Title: Designing Indexed Units of Account 
Abstract: An indexed unit of account is a unit of measurement defined 
 using an index such as a consumer price index so that prices, wages or 
 deferred payments defined in terms of these units will automatically 
 adjust to changing economic conditions. Evidence on money illusion and 
 sticky prices, and evidence from countries (notably Chile) that have 
 created indexed units of account, suggests that creating such indexed 
 units is an important policy option for governments in countries with 
 unstable prices or incomes. 
  
 Choices for governments designing indexed units of account are 
 discussed. Governments may choose to encourage the use of the units 
 only for large long-deferred non-wage payments, or they may choose to 
 go to the opposite extreme of encouraging the use of the units for 
 defining all prices, wages and payments. A general equilibrium model 
 is given that shows the dynamics of prices when all prices are 
 expressed in the units. Governments may choose to link units to a 
 consumer price index or to a per capita income index, and there may 
 be advantages to creating both kinds of units simultaneously. 
 Downward rigidity of real wages might be reduced if wages are 
 denominated in base-income-indexed units of account, where base income 
 is defined so that the growth rate in money value of the unit is 
 biased down relative to actual per capita income growth. Examples of 
 the units for United States are displayed and discussed. Could add 
 description of simulation, if that is added.

Title: On the Skiadas 'Conditional Preference Approach' to Choice 
 Under Uncertainty 
Abstract: We compare the Skiadas approach with the standard Savage 
 framework of choice under uncertainty. At first glance, properties of 
 Skiadas "conditional preferences" such as coherence and disappointment 
 seem analogous to similarly motivated notions of decomposability and 
 disappointment aversion defined on Savage "ex ante preferences." We 
 show, however, that coherence per se places almost no restriction on 
 the structure of ex ante preferences. Coherence is an `external' 
 restriction across preferences whereas notions of decomposability in 
 the Savage framework are 'internal' to the particular preference 
 relation. Similarly, standard notions of disappointment aversion refer
 to 'within act' disappointments. Skiadas's notion of disappointment
 aversion for families of conditional preference relations neither
 implies nor is implied by standard notions of disappointment aversion
 for ex ante preferences.

 usually does not deal well with the potential problem of moral hazard. 
 Once homeowners know that the risk of poor market performance of their 
 homes is borne by investors, they have an incentive to neglect to take 
 steps to maintain the homes' values. They may thus create serious 
 future losses for the investors. A calibrated model for assessing 
 this moral hazard risk is presented that is suitable for a number of 
 home equity conversion forms: 1) reverse mortgages, 2) home equity 
 insurance, 3) shared appreciation mortgages, 4) housing partnerships, 
 5) shared equity mortgages and 6) sale of remainder interest. 
 Modifications of these forms involving real estate price indices are 
 proposed that might deal better with the problem of moral hazard.

 mortgages, housing partnerships, shared equity mortgages, sale of

Title: Wald Revisited:  The Optimal Level of Experimentation 
Abstract: This paper revisits Wald's (1947) sequential experimentation 
 paradigm, now assuming that an impatient decision maker can run 
 variable-size experiments each period at some increasing and strictly 
 convex cost before finally choosing an irreversible action. We
 translate this natural discrete time experimentation story into a 
 tractable control of variance for a continuous time diffusion. Here 
 we robustly characterize the optimal experimentation level: It is 
 rising in the confidence about the project outcome, and for not very 
 convex cost functions, the random process of experimentation levels 
 has a positive drift over time. We also explore several parametric 
 shifts unique to our framework. Among them, we discover what is 
 arguably an 'anti-folk' result: Where the experimentation level is 
 positive, it is often higher for a more impatient decision maker. 
 This paper more generally suggests that a long-sought economic 
 paradigm that delivers a sensible law of demand for information is 
 our dynamic one namely, allowing the decision maker an eternal 
 repurchase (resample) option.

Title: Estimation of Nonparametric Functions in Simultaneous 
 Equations Models, with an Application to Consumer Demand 
Abstract: We present a method for consistently estimating nonparametric 
 functions and distributions in simultaneous equations models. This 
 method is used to identify and estimate a random utility model of 
 consumer demand. Our identification conditions for this particular 
 model extend the results of Houthakker (1950), Uzawa (1971) and 
 Mas-Colell (1977), where a deterministic utility function is uniquely 
 recovered from its deterministic demand function.

Title: Some Simple Games for Teaching and Research. Part 1: 
 Cooperative Games 
Abstract: Over many years some simple cooperative games have been 
 considered in lectures on game theory. The games were selected in 
 order to provide insight into various normative theories of solution 
 to n-person games. It is suggested that the results indicate that 
 when solutions have outcomes in common, predictability is higher 
 than when they are apart. The core is attractive but less so when 
 it is heavily nonsymmetric.

Title: The Equivalence of the Dekel-Fudenberg Iterative Procedure and 
 Weakly Perfect Rationalizability 
Abstract: Two approaches have been proposed in the literature to 
 refine the rationalizability solution concept: either assuming that 
 players make small errors when playing their strategies, or assuming 
 that there is a small amount of payoff uncertainty. We show that both 
 approaches lead to the same refinement if errors are made according 
 to the concept of weakly perfect rationalizability, and there is 
 payoff uncertainty as in Dekel and Fudenberg [Journal of Economic 
 Theory 52 (1990), 243-267]. For both cases, the strategies that 
 survive are obtained by starting with one round of elimination of 
 weakly dominated strategies followed by many rounds of elimination 
 of strictly dominated strategies.

Title: Indexed Units of Account: Theory and Assessment of Historical 
 Experience 
Abstract: An indexed unit of account is a money analogue, used to 
 express prices; the unit's purchasing power is defined by an index. 
 Indexed units of account are not true money in that they are not used 
 as a medium of exchange. The first successful indexed unit of account, 
 the Unidad de Fomento (UF) has been used in Chile since 1967, and has 
 been copied in Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, and Uruguay. The reasons for 
 creating such units are discussed from the standpoint of monetary 
 theory. The experience with such units in Chile is discussed. It is 
 argued that important practical problems in implementing indexation 
 are solved by creating such indexed units of account. The author 
 advocates creating such units in other countries, even countries with 
 relatively low rates of inflation such as the United States, and 
 argues that an alternative definition of the units, relating the units 
 to measures of income, may also be advantageous. Ideally, such indexed 
 units of account might someday be "monetized," i.e., institutions such 
 as debit cards may be devised to allow the units to be used for all 
 transactions, so that the role of conventional money might be reduced 
 to clearing-house functions only.

Title: Uniqueness, Stability, and Comparative Statics in Rationalizable 
 Walrasian Markets 
Abstract: This paper studies the extent to which qualitative features 
 of Walrasian equilibria are refutable given a finite data set. In 
 particular, we consider the hypothesis that the observed data are 
 Walrasian equilibria in which each price vector is locally stable 
 under tatonnement. Our main result shows that a finite set of 
 observations of prices, individual incomes and aggregate consumption 
 vectors is rationalizable in an economy with smooth characteristics 
 if and only if it is rationalizable in an economy in which each 
 observed price vector is locally unique and stable under tatonnement. 
 Moreover, the equilibrium correspondence is locally monotone in a 
 neighborhood of each observed equilibrium in these economies. Thus 
 the hypotheses that equilibria are locally stable under tatonnement, 
 equilibrium prices are locally unique and equilibrium comparative 
 statics are locally monotone are not refutable with a finite data set.

Title: Non-Convex Costs and Capital Utilization: A Study of 
 Production Scheduling at Automobile Assembly Plants 
Abstract: This paper studies how managers at automobile assembly 
 plants organize production across time. Detailed data from eleven 
 single-source automobile assembly plants display considerable 
 cross-plant heterogeneity. At plants which make low- and 
 medium-selling vehicles the capital stock often sits idle, production 
 is more variable than sales, and week-long shutdowns are often used 
 to vary output. In contrast, at plants which make high-selling 
 vehicles, the capital stock rarely sits idle, production is about as 
 variable as sales, and over time -- bit week-long shutdowns -- is 
 most frequently used to vary output. To explain this difference in 
 production scheduling, I formulate and solve a dynamic programming 
 model of a plant manager. The solution to the dynamic program 
 predicts that when sales are low, non-convexities at the plant level 
 induce the manager to bunch production at points of low average cost; 
 thus, the manager uses less than full capital utilization on average 
 and makes production more volatile than sales. When sales are high, 
 the plant operates in a convex region of the cost curve. Hence the 
 manager employs high levels of capital utilization and makes
 production less volatile than sales.

 equations dominate both forecasts from the random walk model and 
 forecasts using the forward rate. The results also suggest that money 
 may be able to be made in the forward markets using the equations.

Title: Why Not Cut Pay? 
Abstract: Over 300 business people, labor leaders, business 
 consultants, and counselors of unemployed people were interviewed 
 during the recession of the early 1990's in order to learn why wages 
 and salaries were declining in only a few firms. Employers believed 
 that cutting pay would hurt employee morale, leading to lower 
 productivity and current or future difficulties with hiring and 
 retention. There were few indications that unemployed people had 
 excessive wage expectations. On the contrary, many unemployed were too 
 flexible and found themselves rejected by firms as overqualified.

Title: Multifractality of Deutschemark/US Dollar Exchange Rates 
Abstract: This paper presents the first empirical investigation of 
 the Multifractal Model of Asset Returns ("MMAR"). The MMAR, 
 developed in Mandelbrot, Fisher, and Calvet (1997), is an alternative 
 to ARCH-type representations for modelling temporal heterogeneity in 
 financial returns. Typically, researchers introduce temporal 
 heterogeneity through time-varying conditional second moments in a 
 discrete time framework. Multifractality introduces a new source of 
 heterogeneity through time-varying local regularity in the price path. 
 The concept of local Holder exponent describes local regularity. 
 Multifractal processes bridge the gap between locally Gaussian (Ito) 
 diffusions and jump-diffusions by allowing a multiplicity of Holder 
 exponents. This paper investigates multifractality in Deutschemark/US 
 Dollar currency exchange rates. After finding evidence of multifractal 
 scaling, we show how to estimate the multifractal spectrum via the 
 Legendre transform. The scaling laws found in the data are replicated 
 in simulations. Further simulation experiments test whether 
 alternative representations, such as FIGARCH, are likely to replicate 
 the multifractal signature of the Deutschemark/US Dollar data. On the 
 basis of this evidence, the MMAR hypothesis appears more likely. 
 Overall, the MMAR is quite successful in uncovering a previously 
 unseen empirical regularity. Additionally, the model generates 
 realistic sample paths, and opens the door to new theoretical and 
 applied approaches to asset pricing and risk valuation. We conclude 
 by advocating further empirical study of multifractality in financial 
 data, along with more intensive study of estimation techniques and 
 inference procedures.

Title: Large Deviations and the Distribution of Price Changes 
Abstract: The Multifractal Model of Asset Returns ("MMAR," see 
 Mandelbrot, Fisher, and Calvet, 1997) proposes a class of 
 multifractal processes for the modelling of financial returns. In 
 that paper, multifractal processes are defined by a scaling law for 
 moments of the processes' increments over finite time intervals. In 
 the present paper, we discuss the local behavior of multifractal 
 processes. We employ local Holder exponents, a fundamental concept 
 in real analysis that describes the local scaling properties of a 
 realized path at any point in time. In contrast with the standard 
 models of continuous time finance, multifractal processes contain a 
 multiplicity of local Holder exponents within any finite time 
 interval. We characterize the distribution of Holder exponents by 
 the multifractal spectrum of the process. For a broad class of 
 multifractal processes, this distribution can be obtained by an 
 application of Cramer's Large Deviation Theory. In an alternative 
 interpretation, the multifractal spectrum describes the fractal 
 dimension of the set of points having a given local Holder exponent. 
 Finally, we show how to obtain processes with varied spectra. This 
 allows the applied researcher to relate an empirical estimate of the 
 multifractal spectrum back to a particular construction of the 
 Stochastic process.

Title: A Multifractal Model of Asset Returns 
Abstract: This paper presents the multifractal model of asset returns 
 ("MMAR"), based upon the pioneering research into multifractal 
 measures by Mandelbrot (1972, 1974). The multifractal model 
 incorporates two elements of Mandelbrot's past research that are now 
 well-known in finance. First, the MMAR contains long-tails, as in 
 Mandelbrot (1963), which focused on Levy-stable distributions. In 
 contrast to Mandelbrot (1963), this model does not necessarily imply 
 infinite variance. Second. the model contains long-dependence, the 
 characteristic feature of fractional Brownian Motion (FBM), 
 introduced by Mandelbrot and van Ness (1968). In contrast to FBM, the 
 multifractal model displays long dependence in the absolute value of 
 price increments, while price increments themselves can be 
 uncorrelated. As such, the MMAR is an alternative to ARCH-type 
 representations that have been the focus of empirical research on the 
 distribution of prices for the past fifteen years. The distinguishing 
 feature of the multifractal model is multi-scaling of the return 
 distribution's moments under time-rescalings. We define multiscaling, 
 show how to generate processes with this property, and discuss how 
 these processes differ from the standard processes of continuous-time 
 finance. The multifractal model implies certain empirical 
 regularities, which are investigated in a companion paper.

Title: Band Spectral Regression with Trending Data 
Abstract: Band spectral regression with deterministic and stochastic 
 trends is considered. It is shown that conventional trend removal 
 by regression in the time domain prior to band spectral regression 
 leads to biased and inconsistent estimates of the parameters in a 
 model with frequency dependent coefficients. Time domain and 
 frequency domain procedures for dealing with this problem are 
 examined. Trend removal in the frequency domain produces unbiased 
 estimates and is recommended. An asymptotic theory is developed and 
 the two cases of stationary data and cointegrated nonstationary data 
 are compared. Efficient band spectral regression estimators and 
 associated inferential methods are provided for models with 
 deterministic and stochastic trends. Some supporting Monte Carlo 
 evidence is presented. An empirical application to the present value 
 model of stock prices is discussed. After removing trends in the 
 frequency domain, we show that, while stock prices and dividends have 
 significant coherence at low frequencies, transitory fluctuations in 
 dividends (i.e., less than 3 years) do not have significant coherence 
 with stock price movements.

Title: Regressions for Partially Identified, Cointegrated 
 Simultaneous Equations 
Abstract: This paper studies regressions for partially identified 
 equations in simultaneous equations models (SEMs) where all the 
 variables are I(l) and cointegrating relations are present. 
 Asymptotic properties of OLS and 2SLS estimators under partial 
 identification are derived. The results show that the 
 identifiability condition is important for consistency of estimates 
 in nonstationary SEMs as it is for stationary SEMS. Also, OLS and 
 2SLS estimators are shown to have different rates of convergence and 
 divergence under partial identification, though they have the same 
 rates of convergence and divergence for the two polar cases of full 
 identification and total lack of identifiability. Even in the case of 
 full identification. however, the OLS and 2SLS estimators have 
 different distributions in the limit. Fully modified OLS regression 
 and leads-and-lags regression methods are also studied. The results 
 show that these two estimators have nuisance parameters in the limit 
 under general assumptions on the regression errors and are not 
 suitable for structural inference. The paper proposes 2SLS versions 
 of these two nonstationary regression estimators that have mixture 
 normal distributions in the limit under general assumptions on the 
 regression errors, that are more efficient than the unmodified 
 estimators, and that are suited to statistical inference using 
 asymptotic chi-squared distributions. Some simulation results are also 
 reported.

Title: An ADF Coefficient Test for a Unit Root in ARMA Models of 
 Unknown Order with Empirical Applications to the U.S. Economy 
Abstract: This paper proposes an ADF coefficient test for detecting 
 the presence of a unit root in ARMA models of unknown order. Our 
 approach is fully parametric. When the time series has an unknown 
 deterministic trend, we propose a modified version of the ADF 
 coefficient test based on quasi-differencing in the construction of 
 the detrending regression as in Elliot, Rothenberg and Stock (1996). 
 The limit distributions of these test statistics are derived. 
 Empirical applications of these tests for common macroeconomic time 
 series in the US economy are reported and compared with the usual ADF 
 t-test.

Title: The Existence and Asymptotic Properties of a Backfitting 
 Projection Algorithm Under Weak Conditions 
Abstract: We derive the asymptotic distribution of a new backfitting 
 procedure for estimating the closest additive approximation to a 
 nonparametric regression function. The procedure employs a recent 
 projection interpretation of popular kernel estimators provided by 
 Mammen et al. (1997), and the asymptotic theory of our estimators is 
 derived using the theory of additive projections reviewed in Bickel 
 et al. (1995). Our procedure achieves the same bias and variance as 
 the oracle estimator based on knowing the other components, and in 
 this sense improves on the method analyzed in Opsomer and Ruppert 
 (1997). We provide 'high level' conditions independent of the sampling 
 scheme. We then verify that these conditions are satisfied in a time 
 series autoregression under weak conditions.

Title: A Model of a Predatory State 
Abstract: We provide a model of a primitive state whose rulers extort 
 taxes for their own ends. This 'predatory' state can result in lower 
 levels of both output and popular welfare than either organized 
 banditry or anarchy. The predatory state may provide public goods, 
 such as protection or irrigation, and hence may superficially resemble 
 a contractual state. But, the ability to provide such goods can 
 actually reduce popular welfare after allowing for tax changes. We 
 compare the revenues raised by taxation with those from banditry 
 to get an idea when primitive states are likely to emerge.
  
 We then consider interactions between bandits and the state. 'Corrupt' 
 side-deals are bad for output and popular welfare, but good for 
 revenue. Even in the absence of such collusion, the existence of a 
 'mafia' and of the state can be good for each other. Competition 
 between organized crime and the state, however, typically reduces 
 popular welfare and pushes the volume of banditry close to its anarchy 
 level. Finally, we extend the basic model to allow the populace to 
 form expectations of tax set by a long-lived king. Our relatively 
 pessimistic conclusions about predatory states extend to this dynamic 
 setting.

Title: A Simple Counterexample to the Bootstrap 
Abstract: The bootstrap of the maximum likelihood estimator of the mean 
 of a sample of iid normal random variables with mean mu and variance 
 one is not asymptotically correct to first order when the mean is 
 restricted to be nonnegative. The problem occurs when the true value 
 of the mean mu equals zero. This counterexample to the bootstrap 
 generalizes to a wide variety of estimation problems in which the true 
 parameter may be on the boundary of the parameter space. We provide 
 some alternatives to the bootstrap that are asymptotically correct to 
 first order.
  
 We consider two types of bootstrap percentile confidence intervals in 
 the above example. We find that they both have asymptotic coverage 
 probability that exceeds the nominal asymptotic level when the true 
 value of the mean it equals zero.

Title: A Stochastic Infinite-Horizon Economy with Secured Lending, or 
 Unsecured Lending and Bankruptcy 
Abstract: Modeling problems for a monetary economy are discussed and 
 some examples are presented in the context of an infinite-horizon 
 economy with one or two types of traders, who use fiat money to buy 
 a single perishable consumption good. Three instances are considered, 
 all with transactions in fiat money. The first model has no borrowing 
 or lending. The second model permits both borrowing and lending, but 
 all loans are secured. The third model has borrowing and unsecured 
 lending, and takes into account the presence of debtors who are unable 
 to honor their debts and go bankrupt. Borrowing and depositing take 
 place through an outside bank, although in some circumstances a money 
 market could be used instead. Conditions for different forms of 
 lending are discussed. This is a survey of three technical papers, 
 where the mathematical models are developed in detail and the proofs 
 are supplied.

Title: Model Selection in Partially Nonstationary Vector 
 Autoregressive Processes with Reduced Rank Structure 
Abstract: The current practice for determining the number of
 cointegrating vectors, or the cointegrating rank, in a vector
 autoregression (VAR) requires the investigator to perform a sequence 
 of cointegration tests. However, as was shown in Johansen (1992), this 
 type of sequential procedure does not lead to consistent estimation of 
 the cointegrating rank. Moreover, these methods take as given the 
 correct specification of the lag order of the VAR, though in actual 
 applications the true lag length is rarely known, Simulation studies 
 by Toda and Phillips (1994) and Chao (1993), on the other hand, have 
 shown that test performance of these procedures can be adversely 
 affected by lag misspecification. 
  
 This paper addresses these issues by extending the analysis of 
 Phillips and Ploberger (1996) on the Posterior Information Criterion 
 (PIC) to a partially nonstationary vector autoregressive process with 
 reduced rank structure. This extension allows lag length and 
 cointegrating rank to be jointly selected by the criterion, and it 
 leads to the consistent estimation of both. In addition, we also 
 evaluate the finite sample performance of PIC relative to existing 
 model selection procedures, BIC and AIC, through a Monte Carlo study. 
 Results here show PIC to perform at least as well and sometimes better 
 than the other two methods in all the cases examined.

Title: The Significance of the Market Portfolio 
Abstract: The market portfolio (world portfolio) is in one sense a 
 least important portfolio to provide to investors; there is always a 
 better portfolio for social planners to make available to them. In a 
 J-agent one-period stochastic endowment economy, where preferences are 
 quadratic, the market portfolio is never spanned by the optimal 
 markets a social planner would create. With identical preferences, the 
 market portfolio is orthogonal to all J - 1 portfolios which achieve 
 a first best solution. These conclusions rely on the assumption that 
 the social planner has perfect information about agents' utilities. 
 We also show that as the contract designer's information about agents' 
 utilities becomes more imperfect, the optimal contracts approach 
 contracts that weight individual endowments in proportion to elements 
 of eigenvectors of the variance matrix of endowments. If there is a 
 substantial market component to endowments than a social planner, for 
 reasons of robustness and simplicity, may conclude that creating a 
 contract to allow trading the market portfolio would be a significant 
 innovation.

Title: Estimation When a Parameter Is on a Boundary: Theory and 
 Applications 
Abstract: This paper establishes the asymptotic distribution of 
 extremum estimators when the true parameter lies on the boundary of 
 the parameter space. The boundary may be linear, curved, and/or 
 kinked. The asymptotic distribution is a function of a multivariate 
 normal distribution in models without stochastic trends and a function 
 of a multivariate Brownian motion in models with stochastic trends. 
 The results apply to a wide variety of estimators and models.
  
 Examples treated explicitly in the paper are: (1) quasi-ML estimation 
 of a random coefficients regression model with some coefficient 
 variances equal to zero, (2) LS estimation of a regression model with 
 nonlinear equality and/or inequality restrictions on the parameters 
 and iid regressors, (3) LS estimation of an augmented Dickey-Fuller 
 regression with unit root and time trend parameters on the boundary of 
 the parameter space, (4) method of simulated moments estimation of a 
 multinomial discrete response model with some random coefficient 
 variances equal to zero, some random effect variances equal to zero, 
 or some measurement error variances equal to zero, (5) quasi-ML 
 estimation of a GARCH(1,q*) or IGARCH(1,q*) model with some GARCH MA 
 parameters equal to zero, (6) semiparametric LS estimation of a 
 partially linear regression model with nonlinear equality and/or 
 inequality restrictions on the parameters, and (7) LS estimation of 
 a regression model with nonlinear equality and/or inequality 
 restrictions on the parameters and integrated regressors.

Title: Beyond the CPI: An Augmented Cost of Living Index (ACOLI) 
Abstract: This note examines the question of calculating an augmented 
 cost of living index (ACOLI). The ACOLI is the appropriate deflator 
 to apply to pretax market incomes when calculating economic 
 well-being. Well-being includes, not only conventional consumer 
 purchases, but also goods and services provided by employers, by 
 mandated social regulations, and by tax-financed public goods. 
 Because such augmented consumption is often provided in ways that 
 raise prices but not market incomes, deflating with conventional 
 price indexes may understate real income growth. An application 
 of the ACOLI approach to the United States during the 1960-1994 
 period indicates that the conventional consumer price index has 
 grown about 15 percent faster than the ACOLI. This correction would 
 reduce the augmented cost of living by 0.40 percent per year over 
 the last 35 years.

Title: Second Order Approximation in a Linear Regression with Heteroskedasticity
 for Unknown Form 
Abstract:  We develop stochastic expansions with remainder oP(n-2 mu), where
 0 < mu < 1/2, for a standardised semiparametric GLS estimator, a standard error,
 and a studentized statistic, in the linear regression model with
 heteroskedasticity of unknown form. We calculate the second moments of the
 truncated expansion, and use these approximations to compare two competing
 estimators and to define a method of bandwidth choice.

Title: Supply Constraints on Employment and Output: NAIRU Versus 
 Natural Rate 
Abstract: NAIRU and NATURAL RATE are not synonymous. NAIRU is a macro 
 outcome of an economy with many labor markets in diverse states of 
 excess demand and excess supply. NAIRU represents an overall balance 
 between the inflation-increasing pressures from excess-demand markets 
 and the inflation-decreasing pressures from excess-supply markets. The 
 natural rate, as described by Friedman, is a feature of Walrasian 
 market-clearing general equilibrium. While the NAIRU fits into a 
 Keynesian model, the natural rate is an aspect of a New Classical 
 model. The determinants of the two are theoretically different, and 
 so are their implications for policy. The NAIRU varies from time to 
 time as the relationships between unemployment, vacancies, and wage 
 changes vary, and as the dispersion of excess demands and supplies 
 across markets changes. In this decade, these developments appear to 
 be reducing the NAIRU, in contrast to the unfavorable circumstances 
 of the 1970s.

Title: Can We Grow Faster? 
Abstract: It is essential to distinguish between limits on national 
 output and limits on its rate of growth. In the short run if output 
 is below potential, demand stimulus can temporarily increase output 
 and employment, with growth rates that cannot be sustained once the 
 economy reaches full employment, potential output. This barrier is 
 commonly called the NAIRU. The paper discusses the possibility that 
 the economy can reach lower unemployment rates than previously 
 thought, without increasing inflation. As to raising the sustainable 
 rate of growth of potential output, the paper discusses skeptically 
 various proposals: fiscal austerity, tax cuts, downsizing government. 
 Many proposals can at best raise the level of output, not its 
 sustainable growth; many can do neither; some are perverse. Government 
 policies to raise national saving, private and public investment in 
 tangible and human capital, science and technology are the best hopes, 
 but the payoffs are likely to be slow.

Title: Some Higher Order Theory for a Consistent Nonparametric Model 
 Specification Test 
Abstract: We provide second order theory for a smoothing-based model

 Edgeworth distributional approximation valid to order close to n^{-1}. 
 This is used to define size-corrected critical values whose null 
 rejection frequency improves on the normal critical values. Our 
 simulations confirm the efficacy of this method in moderate sized 
 samples.

 Asset Pricing Model. This is a criterion that does not require firms 
 to possess information, such as the marginal valuation of revenue 
 across date -- events by shareholders, which is not observable; 
 rather, it is based on information revealed by the prices and payoffs 
 of marketed assets. Under standard assumptions, competitive equilibria 
 exist. But, competitive equilibrium allocations need not satisfy a 
 condition of constrained Pareto optimality that recognizes the 
 incompleteness of the asset market; and, even in the absence of 
 nominal assets, competitive equilibrium allocations are generically 
 indeterminate -- they are determinate if firm consider the commodity 
 payoffs of shares.

Title: Consistent Moment Selection Procedures for Generalized Method 
 of Moments Estimation 
Abstract: This paper considers a generalized method of moments (GMM) 
 estimation problem in which one has a vector of moment conditions, 
 some of which are correct and some incorrect. The paper introduces 
 several procedures for consistently selecting the correct moment 
 conditions. The procedures also can consistently determine whether 
 there is a sufficient number of correct moment conditions to identify 
 the unknown parameters of interest. 
  
 The paper specifies moment selection criteria that are GMM analogues 
 of the widely used BIC and AIC model selection criteria. (The latter 
 is not consistent.) The paper also considers downward and upward 
 testing procedures. 
  
 All of the moment selection procedures discussed in the paper are 
 based on the minimized values of the GMM criterion function for 
 different vectors of moment conditions. The procedures are applicable 
 in time series and cross-sectional contexts. 
  
 Application of the results of the paper to instrumental variables 
 estimation problems yields consistent procedures for selecting 
 instrumental variables.

Title: Expanding the Scope of Individual Risk Management: Moral Hazard 
 and Other Behavioral Considerations 
Abstract: There is a large potential for improving individual risk 
 management through new risk management contracts and associated new 
 index-settled derivatives. However, there are some difficult problems 
 in designing contracts so that they will be used effectively. 
 Individuals have idiosyncratic individual risks that can be hedged 
 only at some real resource cost due to moral hazard. Individuals seem 
 to exhibit behavior indicative of lack of appreciation of the 
 principles of risk management. These problems are discussed, and some 
 potential new risk management contracts that would make improvements 
 in the management of major income risks are proposed.

Title: Stochastic Algorithms for Dynamic Models: Markov Perfect 
 Equilibrium, and the 'Curse' of Dimensionality 
Abstract: This paper provides an algorithm for computing policies for 
 dynamic economic models whose state vectors evolve as ergodic Markov 
 processes. The algorithm can be described as a simple learning process 
 (one that agents might actually use). It has two features which break 
 the relationship between its computational requirements and the 
 dimension of the model's state space. First the integral over future 
 states needed to determine policies is never calculated; rather it is 
 estimated by a simple average of past outcomes. Second, the algorithm 
 never computes policies at all points. Iterations are defined by a 
 location and only policies at that location are computed. Random 
 draws from the distribution determined by those policies determine 
 the next location. This selection only repeatedly hits the recurrent 
 class of points, a subset of the feasible set whose cardinality is not 
 directly tied to the dimension of the state space. Our motivating 
 example is Markov Perfect Equilibria (a leading model of industry 
 dynamics; see Maskin and Tirole, 1988). Though estimators for the 
 primitive parameters of these models are often available, 
 computational problems have made it difficult to use them in applied 
 analysis. We provide numerical results which show that our algorithm 
 can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard algorithms in 
 this case; opening up new possibilities for applied work.

Title: Promises Promises 
Abstract: In the classical general equilibrium model, agents keep all 
 their promises, every good is traded, and competition prevents any 
 agent from earning superior returns on investments in financial 
 markets. In this paper I introduce the age-old problem of broken 
 promises into the general equilibrium model, and I find that a new 
 market dynamic emerges.
  
 Given the legal system and institutions, market forces of supply and 
 demand will establish the collateral levels which are required to 
 secure promises. Since physical collateral will typically be scarce, 
 these collateral levels will be set so low that there is bound to be 
 some default. Many kinds of promises will not be traded, because that 
 also economizes on collateral. Scarce collateral thus creates a 
 mechanism for determining endogenously which assets will be traded, 
 thereby helping to resolve a long standing puzzle in general 
 equilibrium theory. Finally, I shall show that under suitable 
 conditions, in rational expectations equilibrium, some investors will 
 be able to earn higher than normal returns on their investments.
  
 The legal system, in conjunction with the market, will be under 
 constant pressure to expand the potential sources of collateral. This 
 will lead to market innovation.
  
 I illustrate the theoretical points in this paper with some of my 
 experiences on Wall Street as director of fixed income research at the 
 firm of Kidder Peabody.

Title: The Generalized War of Attrition 
Abstract: We generalize the War of Attrition model to allow for N + K 
 firms competing for N prizes. Two special cases are of particular 
 interest. First, if firms continue to pay their full costs after 
 dropping out (as in a standard-setting context), each firm's exit time 
 is independent both of K and of the actions of other players. Second, 
 in the limit in which firms pay no costs after dropping out (as in a 
 natural-oligopoly problem), the field is immediately reduced to N + 1 
 firms. Furthermore, we have perfect sorting, so it is always the K - 1 
 lowest-value players who drop out in zero time, even though each 
 player's value is private information to the player. We apply our 
 model to politics, explaining the length of time it takes to collect 
 a winning coalition to pass a bill.

Title: On the Number of Bootstrap Repetitions for Bootstrap Standard 
 Errors, Confidence Intervals, and Tests 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of choosing the number of 
 bootstrap repetitions B for bootstrap standard errors, confidence 
 intervals, and tests. For each of these problems, the paper provides 
 a three-step method for choosing B to achieve a desired level of 
 accuracy. Accuracy is measured by the percentage deviation of the 
 bootstrap standard error estimate, confidence interval endpoint(s), 
 test's critical value, or test's p-value based on B bootstrap 
 simulations from the corresponding ideal bootstrap quantities for 
 which B = infinity. Monte Carlo simulations show that the proposed 
 methods work quite well.
  
 The results apply quite generally to parametric, semiparametric, and 
 nonparametric models with independent and dependent data. The results 
 apply to the standard nonparametric iid bootstrap, moving block 
 bootstraps for time series data, parametric and semiparametric 
 bootstraps, and bootstraps for regression models based on 
 bootstrapping residuals.

Title: Conditional Independence Restrictions: Testing and Estimation 
Abstract: We propose a nonparametric empirical distribution function 
 based test of an hypothesis of conditional independence between 
 variables of interest. This hypothesis is of interest both for model 
 specification purposes, parametric and semiparametric, and for 
 non-model based testing of economic hypotheses. We allow for both 
 discrete variables and estimated parameters. The asymptotic null 
 distribution of the test statistic is a functional of a Gaussian 
 process. A bootstrap procedure is proposed for calculating the 
 critical values. Our test has power against alternatives at distance 
 n^{-1/2} from the null; this result holding independently of 
 dimension. Monte Carlo simulations provide evidence on size and 
 power. Finally, we invert the test statistic to provide a method for 
 estimating the parameters identified through the conditional 
 independence restriction. They are asymptotically normal at rate 
 root-n.

Title: Hyperfinite Asset Pricing Theory 
Abstract: We present a model of a financial market which unifies the 
 capital-asset-pricing model (CAPM) of Sharpe-Lintner, and the 
 arbitrage pricing theory (APT) of Ross. The model is based on a recent 
 theory of hyperfinite processes, and it uncovers asset pricing 
 phenomena which cannot be treated by classical methods, and whose 
 asymptotic counterparts are not already, or even readily, apparent in 
 the setting of a large but finite number of assets. In the model, an 
 asset's unexpected return can be decomposed into a systematic and an 
 unsystematic part, as in the APT, and the systematic part further 
 decomposed leads to a pricing formula expressed in terms of a beta 
 that is based on a specific index portfolio identifying essential 
 risk, and constructed from factors and factor loadings that are 
 endogenously extracted from the process of asset returns. Furthermore, 
 the valuation formulas of the two individual theories imply, and are 
 implied by, the pervasive economic principle of no arbitrage. Explicit 
 formulas for the characterization, as well as conditions for the 
 existence, of important portfolios are furnished. The hyperfinite 
 factor model possesses an optimality property which justifies the use 
 of a relatively small number of factors to describe the relevant 
 correlational structures. The asymptotic implementability of the 
 idealized limit model is illustrated by an interpretation of selected 
 results for the large but finite setting.

Title: Market Diffusion with Two-Sided Learning 
Abstract: The diffusion of a new product of uncertain value is analyzed 
 in a duopolistic market in continuous time. The two sides of the 
 market, buyers and sellers, learn the true value of the new product 
 over time as a result of experimentation. Buyers have heterogeneous 
 preferences over the products and sellers compete in prices.
  
 The pricing policies and market shares of the sellers in the unique 
 Markov perfect equilibrium are obtained explicitly. The dynamics of 
 the equilibrium market shares display excessive sales of the new 
 product relative to the social optimum in early stages and too low 
 sales later on. The dynamic resolution of uncertainty implies ex post 
 differentiation and hence both sellers value information positively. 
 As information is generated only by experiments with the new product, 
 this relaxes the price competition in the dynamic setting. Finally, 
 the diffusion path of a successful product is shown to be S-shaped.

Title: Bayesian Posterior Distributions in Limited Information Analysis 
 of the Simultaneous Equations Model Using the Jeffreys Prior 
Abstract: This paper studies the use of the Jeffreys' prior in Bayesian 
 analysis of the simultaneous equations model (SEM). Exact 
 representations are obtained for the posterior density of the 
 structural coefficient beta in canonical SEM's with two endogenous 
 variables. For the general case with m endogenous variables and an 
 unknown covariance matrix, the Laplace approximation is used to derive 
 an analytic formula for the same posterior density. Both the exact and 
 the approximate formulas we derive are found to exhibit Cauchy-like 
 tails analogous to comparable results in the classical literature on 
 LIML estimation. Moreover, in the special case of a two-equation, 
 just-identified SEM in canonical form, the posterior density of beta 
 is shown to have the same infinite series representation as the 
 density of the finite sample distribution of the corresponding LIML 
 estimator. 
  
 This paper also examines the occurrence of a nonintegrable asymptotic 
 cusp in the posterior distribution of the reduced form parameter Phi, 
 first documented in Kleibergen and van Dijk (1994). This phenomenon is 
 explained in terms of the jacobian of the mapping from the structural 
 model to the reduced form. This interpretation assists in 
 understanding the success of the Jeffreys' prior in resolving this 
 problem.

Title: Spurious Regression Unmasked 
Abstract: This paper argues that trending time series can admit valid 
 regression representations even when the dependent variable and the 
 regressors are statistically independent, i.e., in situations that are 
 presently characterized in the literature as "spurious regressions." 
 Our theory is directed mainly at the two classic examples of 
 regressions of stochastic trends on time polynomials and regressions 
 among independent random walks. But it has more general applicability 
 and, we think, wider implications. Contrary to established wisdom, our 
 theory justifies regressions of this type as valid models for the 
 data. The radical conclusion that emerges from this study is that 
 there are no spurious regressions for trending time series, just 
 alternative valid representations of the limiting dependent variable 
 process in terms of other stochastic processes and deterministic 
 functions of time. We find statistical inference in such cases to be 
 valid, not spurious, a conclusion that is in direct contrast to 
 universal thinking about this subject since Yule (1926) first wrote 
 about nonsense correlations.

Title: Efficiency Gains from Quasi-Differencing Under Nonstationarity 
Abstract: A famous theorem on trend removal by OLS regression (usually 
 attributed to Grenander and Rosenblatt, 1957) gave conditions for the 
 asymptotic equivalence of GLS and OLS in deterministic trend 
 extraction. When a time series has trend components that are 
 stochastically nonstationary, this asymptotic equivalence no longer 
 holds. We consider models with integrated and near-integrated error 
 processes where this asymptotic equivalence breaks down. In such 
 models, the advantages of GLS can be achieved through 
 quasi-differencing and we give an asymptotic theory of the relative 
 gains that occur in deterministic trend extraction in such cases. 
 Some differences between models with and without intercepts are 
 explored.

Title: Price Variations in a Stock Market with Many Agents 
Abstract: Large variations in stock prices happen with sufficient 
 frequency to raise doubts about existing models, which all fail to 
 account for non-Gaussian statistics. We construct simple models of a 
 stock market, and argue that the large variations may be due to a 
 crowd effect, where agents imitate each other's behavior. The 
 variations over different time scales can be related to each other 
 in a systematic way, similar to the Levy stable distribution proposed 
 by Mandelbrot to describe real market indices. In the simplest, 
 least realistic case, exact results for the statistics of the 
 variations are derived by mapping onto a model of diffusing and 
 annihilating particles, which has been solved by quantum field theory 
 methods. When the agents imitate each other and respond to recent 
 market volatility, different scaling behavior is obtained. In this 
 case the statistics of price variations is consistent with empirical 
 observations. The interplay between "rational" traders whose behavior 
 is derived from fundamental analysis of the stock, including 
 dividends, and "noise traders," whose behavior is governed solely by 
 studying the market dynamics, is investigated. When the relative 
 number of rational traders is small, "bubbles" often occur, where the 
 market price moves outside the range justified by fundamental market 
 analysis. When the number of rational traders is large, the market 
 price is generally locked within the price range they define.

Title: Nash and Walras Equilibrium 
Abstract: The existence of Nash and Walras equilibrium is proved via 
 Brouwer's Fixed Point Theorem, without recourse to Kakutani's Fixed 
 Point Theorem for correspondences. The domain of the Walras fixed 
 point map is confined to the price simplex, even when there is 
 production and weakly quasi-convex preferences. The key idea is to 
 replace optimization with "satisficing improvement," i.e., to replace 
 the Maximum Principle with the "Satisficing Principle."

Title: The Asymptotic Distribution of Nonparametric Estimates of the 
 Lyapunov Exponent for Stochastic Time Series 
Abstract: This paper derives the asymptotic distribution of a 
 smoothing-based estimator of the Lyapunov exponent for a stochastic 
 time series under two general scenarios. In the first case, we are 
 able to establish root-T consistency and asymptotic normality, while 
 in the second case, which is more relevant for chaotic processes, we 
 are only able to establish asymptotic normality at a slower rate of 
 convergence. We provide consistent confidence intervals for both 
 cases. We apply our procedures to simulated data.

Title: Estimated Inflation Costs Had European Unemployment Been Reduced 
 in the 1980s by Macro Prices 
Abstract: This paper uses a multicountry econometric model to estimate 
 what the inflation costs would have been if macropolicies had reduced 
 European unemployment in the 1982:1-1990:4 period. A "non-NAIRU" 
 framework is proposed for thinking about these costs.

Title: The Hangman's Paradox and Newcomb's Paradox as Psychological 
 Games 
Abstract: We present a (hopefully) fresh interpretation of the 
 Hangman's Paradox and Newcomb's Paradox by casting the puzzles in the 
 language of modern game theory, instead of in the realm of 
 epistemology. Game theory moves the analysis away from the formal 
 logic of the puzzles toward more practical problems, such as: On what 
 day would the executioner hang the prisoner if he wanted to surprise 
 him as much as possible? How should a surprise test be administered? 
 We argue that both the Hangman's Paradox and Newcomb's Paradox are 
 analogous to a well-known phenomenon in game theory, that giving a 
 player an additional attractive (even dominant) strategy may make him 
 worse off.
  
 In the Hangman's Paradox, the executioner is determined to surprise 
 the prisoner as much as possible, yet he cannot surprise him at all 
 because he cannot commit in advance to a random schedule. The 
 possibility of changing his mind (i.e., the presence of alternative 
 strategies) superficially would seem to help the executioner, but 
 because it changes the expectations of the prisoner, in the end it 
 works dramatically to his disadvantage. In Newcomb's Paradox, a man 
 given an extra dominant choice is worse off because it changes God's 
 expectations about what he will do.
  
 Our analysis cannot be couched in terms of the standard Nash framework 
 of games, but must instead be put in a recent extension called 
 psychological games, where payoffs may depend on beliefs as well as on 
 actions.

Title: Matrices with Identical Sets of Neighbors 
Abstract: Given a generic m by n matrix A, a lattice point h in {bold Z} 
 is a neighbor of the origin if the body {x : Ax <= b}, with b_{i} = 
 max{0, a_{i}h}, i = 1, ..., m, contains no lattice point other than 0 
 and h. The set of neighbors, N(A), is finite and Asymmetric. We show 
 that if A' is another matrix of the same size with the property that 
 sign a_{i}h = sign a'_{i} in h for every i and every h in N(A), then 
 A' has precisely the same set of neighbors as A. The collection of 
 such matrices is a polyhedral cone, described by a finite set of 
 linear inequalities, each such inequality corresponding to a generator 
 of one of the cones C_{i} = pos(h in N(A) : a_{i}h < 0}. Computational 
 experience shows that C_{i} has "few" generators. We demonstrate this 
 in the first nontrivial case n = 3, m = 4.

Title: Incomplete Derivative Markets and Portfolio Insurance 
Abstract: We present necessary and sufficient conditions on the asset 
 span of incomplete derivative markets for insuring marketed 
 portfolios. If the asset span is finite dimensional there exists a 
 polynomial-time algorithm for deciding if every marketed portfolio is 
 insurable, moreover this algorithm computes the minimum cost insurance 
 portfolio. 
  
 In addition, we extend the Cox-Leland characterization of optimal 
 portfolio insurance in complete derivative markets to asset spans of 
 incomplete derivative markets where every marketed portfolio is 
 insurable.

Title: A Scorecard for Indexed Government Debt 
Abstract: Within the last five years, Canada, Sweden and New Zealand 
 have joined the ranks of the United Kingdom and other countries in 
 issuing government bonds that are indexed to inflation. Some 
 observers of the experience in these countries have argued that the 
 United States should follow suit. This paper provides an overview of 
 the issues surrounding debt indexation, and it tries to answer three 
 empirical questions about indexed debt. First, how different would 
 the returns on indexed bonds be from the returns on existing US debt 
 instruments? Second, how would indexed bonds affect the government's 
 average financing costs? Third, how might the Federal Reserve be able 
 to use the information contained in the prices of indexed bonds to 
 help formulate monetary policy? The paper concludes with a more 
 speculative discussion of the possible consequences of increased use 
 of indexed debt contracts by the private sector.

Title: Tests of Seasonal and Non-Seasonal Serial Correlation 
Abstract: This paper considers tests for seasonal and non-seasonal 
 serial correlation in time series and in the errors of regression 
 models. The problem of testing for white noise against multiplicative 
 seasonal ARMA(l,l)-ARMA(l,l) alternatives is investigated. This 
 testing problem is non-standard due to nuisance parameters that 
 appear under the alternative but not under the null hypothesis. The 
 likelihood ratio (LR), sup Lagrange multiplier (LM), and exponential 
 average LM and LR tests are considered and are shown to be 
 asymptotically admissible for multiplicative seasonal 
 ARMA(l,l)-ARMA(l,l) alternatives. In addition, they are shown to be 
 consistent against all (weakly stationary strong mixing) non-white 
 noise alternatives. Simulation results compare the tests to several 
 tests in the literature. The exponential average test, 
 Exp-LR_{infinity}, is found to be the best test overall. It performs 
 substantially better than the Box-Pierce, Durbin-Watson, and Wallis 
 tests. 
Keywords: Autoregressive moving average model, consistent test, 
 Lagrange multiplier test, likelihood ratio test, multiplicative 
 seasonal ARMA model, nonstandard testing problem, seasonality, test of 
 white noise.

Title: Three Brief Proofs of Arrow's Impossibility Theorem 
Abstract: Arrow's original proof of his impossibility theorem proceeded 
 in two steps: showing the existence of a decisive voter, and then 
 showing that a decisive voter is a dictator. Barbera replaced the 
 decisive voter with the weaker notion of a pivotal voter, thereby 
 shortening the first step, but complicating the second step. I give 
 three brief proofs, all of which turn on replacing the 
 decisive/pivotal voter with an extremely pivotal voter (a voter who by 
 unilaterally changing his vote can move some alternative from the 
 bottom of the social ranking to the top), thereby simplifying both 
 steps in Arrow's proof. 
  
 My first proof is the most straightforward, and the second uses 
 Condorcet preferences (which are transformed into each other by moving 
 the bottom alternative to the top). The third (and shortest) proof 
 proceeds by reinterpreting Step 1 of the first proof as saying that 
 all social decisions are made the same way (neutrality).

Title: Market Experimentation and Pricing 
Abstract: We present a continuous-time model of Bayesian learning in a 
 duopolistic market. Initially the value of one product offered is 
 unknown to the market. The market participants learn more about the 
 true value of the product as experimentation occurs over time. Firms 
 set prices to induce experimentation with their product. The aggregate 
 outcomes are public information. 
  
 As agents learn from the experiments of others, informational 
 externalities arise. Surprisingly, the informational externality leads 
 to too much learning. Buyers do not consider the impact of their 
 experimentation on other buyers while the sellers internalize the 
 gains from experiments conducted by the buyers. The firms free ride on 
 the market as the social costs of experiments are not appropriately 
 reflected in the equilibrium prices. The value functions of the 
 sellers display preference for information in contrast to the buyers 
 who are information averse. 
  
 We determine Markov Perfect Equilibrium prices and allocations in this 
 two-sided learning model. The analysis is presented for a finite 
 number of buyers as well as for a continuum of buyers. The severity of 
 the inefficiency is shown to be monotonically increasing in the number 
 of buyers.

Title: Testing the Standard View of the Long-Run Unemployment-Inflation 
 Relationship 
Abstract: The results in this paper, based on estimating and testing 
 price equations for 30 countries, do not support the standard view of 
 the long-run relationship between unemployment and inflation. They 
 overwhelmingly reject the dynamics implied by the standard view. Wage 
 equations are also estimated and tested. The paper also attempts to 
 estimate the functional form of the relationship between measures of 
 demand pressure and price and wage levels, but no strong conclusions 
 emerge.

Title: A Stopping Rule for the Computation of Generalized Method of 
 Moments Estimators 
Abstract: To obtain consistency and asymptotic normality, a generalized 
 method of moments (GMM) estimator typically is defined to be an 
 approximate global minimizer of a GMM criterion function. To compute 
 such an estimator, however, can be problematic because of the 
 difficulty of global optimization. In consequence, practitioners 
 usually ignore the problem and take the GMM estimator to be the result 
 of a local optimization algorithm. This yields an estimator that is 
 not necessarily consistent and asymptotically normal. The use of a 
 local optimization algorithm also can run into the problem of 
 instability due to flats or ridges in the criterion function, which 
 makes it difficult to know when to stop the algorithm. 
  
 To alleviate these problems of global and local optimization, we 
 propose a stopping-rule (SR) procedure for computing GMM estimators. 
 The SR procedure eliminates the need for global search with high 
 probability. And, it provides an explicit SR for problems of stability 
 that may arise with local optimization problems.

Title: Semiparametric Estimation of a Sample Selection Model 
Abstract: This paper provides a consistent and asymptotically normal 
 estimator for the intercept of a semiparametrically estimated sample 
 selection model. The estimator uses a decreasingly small fraction of 
 all observations as the sample size goes to infinity, as in Heckman 
 (1990). In the semiparametrics literature, estimation of the intercept 
 typically has been subsumed in the nonparametric sample selection bias 
 correction term. The estimation of the intercept, however, is 
 important from an economic perspective. For instance, it permits one 
 to determine the "wage gap" between unionized and nonunionized 
 workers, decompose the wage differential between different 
 socioeconomic groups (e.g., male-female and black-white), and evaluate 
 the net benefits of a social program.

Title: An Asymptotic Expansion in the Garch(1,1) Model 
Abstract: We develop order T^{-1} asymptotic expansions for the 
 quasi-maximum likelihood estimator (QMLE) and a two step approximate 
 QMLE in the GARCH(1,1) model. We calculate the approximate mean and 
 skewness and hence the Edgeworth-B distribution function. We suggest 
 several methods of bias reduction based on these approximation.

Title: What is the Value of Scientific Knowledge? An Application to 
 Global Warming Using the PRICE Model 
Abstract: Governments must cope with the enormous uncertainties about 
 both future climate change as well as the costs and benefits of 
 slowing climate change. This study analyses the value of improved 
 information about a variety of geophysical and economic processes. The 
 value of information is estimated using the "PRICE model" which is a 
 probabilistic extension of earlier models of the economics of global 
 warming. The study uses five different approaches to estimating the 
 value of information about all uncertain parameters and about 
 individual parameters. It is estimated that the value of early 
 information is between $1.5 and $2 billion for each year that 
 resolution of uncertainty is moved toward the present. We estimate 
 that the most important uncertain variables are the damages of climate 
 change and the costs of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Resolving 
 the uncertainties about these two parameters would contribute 75 
 percent of the value of improved knowledge.

Title: Explaining the Labor Force Participation of Women 20-24 
Abstract: Between about the mid 1960s and the late 1970s there was a 
 remarkable rise in the labor force participation of women and then a 
 leveling off that has persisted through the mid 1990s. This paper 
 attempts to explain the labor force participation of women 20-24 over 
 this period. A "relative income" variable is constructed based on 
 Easterlin's (1980) relative income hypothesis, and this is found to be 
 an important explanatory variable. Easterlin's "cohort wage" 
 hypothesis is also used in the analysis. The basic equation estimated 
 does very well in various tests that were performed on it, and it 
 appears to explain well the rapid rise and then leveling off of the 
 labor force participation of young women.

Title: Why Do People Dislike Inflation? 
Abstract: A questionnaire survey was conducted to explore how people 
 think about inflation, and what real problems they see it as causing. 
 With results from 677 people, comparisons were made among people in 
 the U.S., Germany, and Brazil, between young and old, and between 
 economists and non-economists. Among non-economists in all countries, 
 the largest concern with inflation appears to be that it lowers 
 people's standard of living. Non-economists appear often to believe in 
 a sort of sticky-wage model, by which wages do not respond to 
 inflationary shocks, shocks which are themselves perceived as caused 
 by certain people or institutions acting badly. This standard of 
 living effect is not the only perceived cost of inflation among 
 non-economists; other perceived costs are tied up with issues of 
 exploitation, political instability, loss of morale, and damage to 
 national prestige. The most striking differences between groups 
 studied were between economists and non-economists. There were also 
 important international and intergenerational differences. The 
 U.S.-Germany differences (on questions not just about information) 
 were usually less strong than the intergenerational differences.

Title: Preference for Information 
Abstract: What is the relationship between an agent's attitude towards 
 information, and her attitude towards risk? If an agent always prefers 
 more information, does this imply that she obeys the independence 
 axiom? We provide a substitution property on preferences that is 
 equivalent to the agent (intrinsically) liking information in the 
 absence of contingent choices. We use this property to explore both 
 questions, first in general, then for recursive smooth preferences, 
 and then in specific recursive non-expected utility models. Given 
 smoothness, for both the rank dependence and betweenness models, if an 
 agent is information-loving then her preferences can depart from Kreps 
 and Porteus's (1978) temporal expected utility model in at most one 
 stage. This result does not extend to quadratic utility. Finally, we 
 give several conditions such that, provided the agent intrinsically 
 likes information, Blackwell's (1953) result holds; that is, she will 
 always prefer more informative signals, whether or not she can 
 condition her subsequent behavior on the signal.

Title: Learning and Strategic Pricing 
Abstract: We consider the situation where a single consumer buys a 
 stream of goods from different sellers over time. The true value of 
 each seller's product to the buyer is initially unknown. Additional 
 information can be gained only by experimentation. For exogenously 
 given prices the buyer's problem is a multi-armed bandit problem. The 
 innovation in this paper is to endogenize the cost of experimentation 
 to the consumer by allowing for price competition between the sellers. 
 The role of prices is then to allocate intertemporally the costs and 
 benefits of learning between buyer and sellers. We examine how 
 strategic aspects of the oligopoly model interact with the learning 
 process. 
  
 All Markov Perfect Equilibria (MPE) are efficient. We identify an 
 equilibrium which besides its unique robustness properties has a 
 strikingly simple, seemingly myopic pricing rule. Prices below 
 marginal cost emerge naturally to sustain experimentation. 
 Intertemporal exchange of the gains of learning is necessary to 
 support efficient experimentation. We analyze the asymptotic behavior 
 of the equilibria.

Title: Time and Money 
Abstract: General equilibrium is timeless, and without outside money, 
 the price system is homogeneous of order zero. Some finite horizon 
 strategic market game models are considered with an initial issue of 
 flat money held as an asset. For any arbitrary finite horizon, the 
 solution is time-dependent. In the infinite horizon, time disappears 
 with the initial issue of flat money present as circulating capital 
 in the fully stationary state and the price level is determined.

Title: A Conditional Kolmogorov Test 
Abstract: This paper introduces a conditional Kolmogorov test of model 
 specification for parametric models with covariates (regressors). The 
 test is an extension of the Kolmogorov test of goodness-of-fit for 
 distribution functions. The test is shown to have power against 
 1/{root n}-local alternatives and all fixed alternatives to the null 
 hypothesis. A parametric bootstrap procedure is used to obtain 
 critical values for the test.

Title: Labor Income Indices Designed for Use in Contracts Promoting 
 Income Risk Management 
Abstract: Labor income indices are created for groupings of individuals, 
 using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. People are grouped 
 by a clustering algorithm based on an estimated transition matrix 
 between jobs, by education level, and by skill category. The groups 
 are defined so that relatively few people move between them. For each 
 of the groupings, we generate a labor income index using a hedonic 
 repeated-measures regression methodology. Similarities between pairs 
 of indices and between indices and individual labor incomes are 
 described. It is argued that indices like those presented here might 
 someday be used in settlement formulae in contracts promoting income 
 risk management.

Title: Evaluating the Probability of Failure of a Banking Firm  
Abstract: We develop a dynamic model in which the probability of 
 failure of an infinitely lived financial intermediary (bank) is 
 determined endogenously as a function of observable state and policy 
 variables. The bank takes into account the effect of the optimal 
 policy (the interest on deposits, dividend payouts, risky investments) 
 on the probability of failure, which in turn affects the bank's 
 ability to extract deposits. With the aid of simulations we study the 
 effect of variables such as bank size, the riskiness of the bank's 
 investment opportunities, and reserve requirements on the bank's 
 optimal policy and on its probability of failure. A major finding is 
 that small banks choose policies that render them more risky than 
 large banks. As the risks are correctly priced by depositors, rates 
 offered by small banks incorporate substantial risk premia. Another 
 interesting finding is that a tighter reserve requirement induces 
 banks of all sizes to take fewer risks.

Title: Information Externalities, Share-Price Based Incentives and 
 Managerial Behaviour 
Abstract: We survey recent theoretical research on the effects of 
 short-term share-price based marginal incentive schemes. Such schemes 
 can induce inefficient managerial behaviour in both hidden action and 
 hidden type contexts. These problems arise from informational 
 asymmetries: managers take actions to manipulate the information flow 
 rather than to maximize firm value. More generally, imperfect 
 transmission of information between managers and shareholders or 
 between managers of different firms can lead to similar distortions 
 even when the parties' interests are aligned.

Title: Testing Additivity in Generalized Nonparametric Regression 
 Models 
Abstract: We propose a nonparametric test of conditional independence 
 based on the empirical distribution function. The asymptotic null 
 distribution is a mixture of chi-squares. A bootstrap procedure is 
 proposed for calculating the critical values. Our test has power 
 against alternatives at distance n^{-1/2} from the null. Monte Carlo 
 simulations provide evidence on size and power. We apply the test to 
 the Boston housing dataset.

Title: Adaptive Testing in ARCH Models 
Abstract: Existing specification tests for conditional 
 heteroskedasticity are derived under the assumption that the density 
 of the innovation, or standardized error, is Gaussian, despite the 
 fact that many recent empirical studies provide evidence that this 
 density is not Gaussian. We obtain specification tests for conditional 
 heteroskedasticity under the assumption that the innovation density is 
 a member of a general family of densities. Our test statistics 
 maximize asymptotic local power and weighted average power criteria 
 for the general family of densities. We establish both first order and 
 second order theory for our procedures. Monte Carlo simulations 
 indicate that asymptotic power gains are achievable in finite samples. 
 We apply the tests to shock futures data sampled at high frequency and 
 find evidence of conditional heteroskedasticity in the residuals from 
 a GARCH(1,1) model, indicating that the standard (1,1) specification 
 is not adequate.

Title: Automated Forecasts of Asia-Pacific Economic Activity  
Abstract: This paper reports quarterly ex ante forecasts of 
 macroeconomic activity for the U.S.A., Japan and Australia for the 
 period 1995-1997. The forecasts are based on automated time series 
 models of vector autoregressions (VAR's), reduced rank regressions 
 (RRR's), error correction models (ECM's) and Bayesian vector 
 autoregressions (BVAR's). The models are automated by using an 
 asymptotic predictive form of the model selection criterion PIC to 
 determine autoregressive lag order, cointegrating rank and trend 
 degree in the VAR's, RRR's, and ECM's. The same criterion is used to 
 find optimal values of the hyperparameters in the BVAR's. The 
 forecasts are graphed and tabulated. In the case of the U.S.A., the 
 results are compared with forecasts from the Fair model, a structural 
 econometric model of the U.S. economy.

Title: Impulse Response and Forecast Error Variance Asymptotics in 
 Nonstationary VAR's 
Abstract: Impulse response and forecast error variance matrix 
 asymptotics are developed for VAR models with some roots at or near 
 unity and some cointegration. For such models, it is shown that 
 impulse responses that are estimated from an unrestricted VAR are 
 inconsistent at long horizons and tend to random variables rather 
 than the true impulse responses in the limit. The asymmetric 
 distribution of the limit variates helps to explain the asymmetry of 
 the finite sample distributions of the estimated impulse responses 
 that is often found in simulations. VAR regressions also give 
 inconsistent estimates of the forecast error variance of the optimal 
 predictor at long horizons, and have a tendency to understate this 
 variance. Moreover, predictions from an unrestricted nonstationary 
 VAR are not optimal in the sense that they do not converge to the 
 optimal predictors, at least for long horizons. In these respects, 
 the asymptotic theory of prediction and policy analysis for 
 nonstationary VAR's is very different from that which applies in 
 stationary VAR's. By contrast, in a reduced rank regression the 
 impulse response and forecast error variance matrix estimates are 
 consistent and predictions from the fitted RRR model are 
 asymptotically optimal, all provided the cointegrating rank is 
 correctly specified or consistently estimated. Some simulations are 
 reported which show these findings to be relevant in finite samples, 
 and which assess the sensitivity of forecasting performance and policy 
 analysis to certain design features of models in the VAR class.

Title: How Should We Measure Sustainable Income? 
Abstract: Growing concerns about long-run economic growth have led to 
 calls for measures of "sustainable income." Traditional analyses rely 
 on Hicksian income, which is consumption plus net investment. The 
 present paper shows that Hicksian income corresponds to sustainable 
 income only under implausibly limited circumstances. We define 
 sustainable income and estimate its magnitude for the United States. 
 The analysis and empirical estimates indicate, first, that consumption 
 has historically been far below sustainable income; second, that 
 conventional Hicksian measures of national income are poor proxies for 
 sustainable income; and, third, that the true savings rate has 
 declined significantly in the last two decades.

Title: Banks versus Bonds: A Simple Theory of Comparative Financial 
 Institutions 
Abstract: We use a simple, graphical moral hazard model to compare 
 monitored bank lending versus non-monitored bond issues as sources of 
 external funds for industry. We contrast the conditions that 
 theoretically favor each system, such as the size and number of firms, 
 with conditions prevailing when these financial systems were developed 
 during the British and German Industrial Revolutions. Then, to address 
 the question why different systems have persisted, we embed the model 
 in an entry game in which firm size and number are endogenous. We show 
 that multiple equilibria can exist if financiers take the industrial 
 structure as given and vice versa. Finally, we compare these 
 equilibria in welfare terms.

Title: A Strategic Market Game with Secured Lending 
Abstract: We study stationary Markov equilibria for strategic, 
 competitive games, in a market-economy model with one non-durable 
 commodity, fiat money, borrowing/lending through a central bank or a 
 money market, and a continuum of agents. These use fiat money in order 
 to offset random fluctuations in their endowments of the commodity, 
 are not allowed to borrow more than they can pay back (secured 
 lending), and maximize expected discounted utility from consumption of 
 the commodity. Their aggregate optimal actions determine dynamically 
 prices and/or interest rates for borrowing and lending, in each period 
 of play. In equilibrium, random fluctuations in endowment- and 
 wealth-levels offset each other, and prices and interest rates remain 
 constant.
  
 As in our related recent work, KSS (1994), we study in detail the 
 individual agents' dynamic optimization problems, and the invariance 
 measures for the associated, optimally controlled Markov chains. By 
 appropriate aggregation, these individual problems lead to the 
 construction of stationary Markov competitive equilibrium for the 
 economy as a whole. 
  
 Several examples are studied in detail, fairly general existence 
 theorems are established, and open questions are indicated for further 
 research.

Title: Mortgage Default Risk and Real Estate Prices: The Use of 
 Index-Based Futures and Options in Real Estate 
Abstract: Evidence is shown, using US foreclosure data by state 1975-93,
 that periods of high default rates on home mortgages strongly tend to
 follow real estate price declines or interruptions in real estate price
 increase. The relation between price decline and foreclosure rates is
 modelled using a distributed lag. Using this model, holders of
 residential mortgage portfolios could hedge some of the risk of default
 by taking positions in futures or options markets for residential real
 estate prices, were such markets to be established.

Title: World Income Components: Measuring and Exploiting International 
 Risk Sharing Opportunities 
Abstract: We provide methods of decomposing the variance of world 
 national incomes into components in such a way as to indicate the most 
 important risk-sharing opportunities, and, therefore, the most 
 important missing international risk markets to establish. One method 
 uses a total variance reduction criterion, and identified risk-sharing 
 opportunities in terms of eigenvectors of a variance matrix of 
 residuals produced when country incomes are regressed on world income. 
 Another method uses a mean-variance utility-maximizing criterion and 
 identifies risk-sharing opportunities in terms of eigenvectors of a 
 variance matrix of deviations of country incomes from their respective 
 contract-year shares of world income.
  
 The two methods are applied using Summers-Heston [1991] data on 
 national incomes for large countries 1950-1990, each using two 
 different methods of estimating variances. While these data are not 
 sufficient to provide accurate estimates of the requisite variance 
 matrices of (transformed) national incomes, the results are suggestive 
 of important new markets that could actually be created, and show that 
 there may be large welfare gains to creating some of these markets.

Title: Quantile Regression Model with Unknown Censoring Point 
Abstract: The paper introduces an estimator for the linear censored 
 quantile regression model when the censoring point is an unknown 
 function of a set of regressors. The objective function minimized is 
 convex and the minimization problem is a linear programming problem, 
 for which there is a global minimum. The suggested procedure applies 
 also to the special case of a fixed known censoring point. Under 
 fairly weak conditions the estimator is shown to have n-convergence 
 rate and is asymptotically normal. In the special case of a fixed 
 censoring point it is asymptotically equivalent to the estimator 
 suggested by Powell (1984, 1986a). A Monte Carlo study performed 
 shows that the suggested estimator has very desirable small sample 
 properties. It precisely corrects for the bias induced by censoring, 
 even when there is a large amount of censoring, and for relatively 
 small sample sizes. The estimator outperforms that suggested by 
 Powell in cases where both apply.

Title: Dumb Bugs and Bright Noncooperative Players: Games, Context 
 and Behavior 
Abstract: Consider a repeated bimatrix game. We define "bugs" as 
 players whose "strategy" is to react myopically to whatever the 
 opponent did on the previous iteration. We believe that in some 
 contexts this is a more realistic model of behavior than the standard 
 "supremely rational" noncooperative game player.
  
 We consider possible outcome paths that can occur as the result of 
 bugs playing a game. We also compare how bugs fare over a suitable 
 "universe of games," as compared with standard "Nash" players and 
 "maximin" players.

Title: An Overview of the General Theory 
Abstract: This paper is intended to be a chapter in a forthcoming 
 "Second Edition" of John Maynard Keynes, The General Theory of 
 Employment, Interest and Money, published in one single edition in 
 1936. The Second Edition is being edited by Geoffrey Harcourt and 
 Peter Riach and will contain contributions by 30 or 40 authors. It is 
 to be published by Routledge, it is hoped in 1996, the 60th birthday 
 of the great book. Most of the contributions correspond to the 
 chapters of the original book, and others are essays about the book 
 or natural extensions of it. The chapter of the Second Edition I was 
 asked to write might be regarded as a revision of Keynes's Chapter 18, 
 "The General Theory of Employment Restated," but it is meant to be 
 more inclusive and may appear as a preface or conclusion to the 
 Second Edition. 
  
 Each of the proposed revised chapters of The General Theory is meant 
 to be what the 1994 author thinks Keynes would have written if he had 
 had the time and health to prepare a revised edition by 1946. This 
 revision, written as if by Keynes some fifty years ago, is Part I of 
 a Second Edition chapter. In part II the modern author gives his or 
 her own view of the state of the topic in the 1990s. Those are the 
 functions of Parts I and II of my paper. 
  
 It is a daunting task to take on the role of Keynes. It's presumptuous 
 too. I know I can't write, either in content or style, as Keynes 
 would have done. I have not tried to be a close scholar of the Keynes 
 papers, inferring from them what his own second edition in the 1940s 
 would have said. Although I have stuck close to the essential themes 
 of 1936, as I understand them, I am sure that much of what I have 
 written is colored by what I would like a second edition prepared by 
 Keynes himself to have said. In Part II I discuss changes in Keynesian 
 theory suggested by events in the world and in professional 
 macroeconomics since World War II, and I argue that Keynes still has 
 the better of the big debate.

Title: Conversation, Information, and Herd Behavior 
Abstract: Experimental evidence shows that an important reason why 
 people tend to imitate others, to exhibit "herd behavior" is that they 
 assume that the others have information that justifies their actions. 
 The information cascade models of Banerjee [1992] and Bikhchandani et 
 al. [1992] are significant developments in showing some general 
 equilibrium and welfare effects of such rational imitative behavior. 
 But these models as specified may be of limited applicability since 
 they assert that differences across groups in herd behavior can be 
 attributed to the random decisions of first movers. Differences across 
 groups in herd behavior might be explained more often in terms of 
 different modes of interpersonal information transmission. Patterns of 
 human conversation imply great selectivity to the kinds of information 
 transmitted within groups.

Title: Evaluating Alternative Monetary Policy Rules 
Abstract: This paper examines monetary policy from an optimal control 
 perspective. Three loss functions are minimized for each of three 
 models, and the results are compared. The three loss functions target 
 nominal growth, real growth, and inflation, respectively. The three 
 models are a small structural model, a VAR model, and a large 
 structural model. A numerical procedure is presented that can handle 
 a variety of loss functions and models.

Title: Unemployment and Liquidity Constraints 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a modelling approach for labor 
 supply and consumption decisions that is firmly grounded within a 
 utility maximizing framework and allows for a role of such 
 institutional constraints as limited access to borrowing and 
 involuntary unemployment. We report estimations for a system of 
 dynamic probit models with data from the Panel Study of Income 
 Dynamics. These estimations test broad predictions of the theoretical 
 model. One of our models describes a household's propensity to be 
 liquidity constrained in a given period. The second is a dynamic 
 ordered probit model for a labor constraint indicator describing 
 qualitative aspects of the conditions of employment, that is whether 
 the household head is involuntarily overemployed, voluntarily 
 employed, or involuntarily underemployed or unemployed. These models 
 are estimated separately as well as jointly. Our results provide 
 strong support for the basic theory of constrained behavior and the 
 interaction between liquidity constraints and exogenous constraints 
 on labor supply.

Title: On the Number of Nash Equilibria in a Bimatrix Game 
Abstract: We show that if y is an odd integer between 1 and 2^{n} - 1, 
 there is an n x n bimatrix game with exactly y Nash equilibria (NE). 
 We conjecture that this 2^{n} - 1 is a tight upper for n <= 3, and 
 provide bounds on the number of NEs in m x n nondegenerate games when 
 min(m,n) <= 4.

Title: A Model of Migration 
Abstract: A simple game-theoretic model of migration is proposed, in 
 which the players are animals, the strategies are territories in a 
 landscape to which they may migrate, and the payoffs for each animal 
 are determined by its ultimate location and the number of other 
 animals there. If the payoff to an animal is a decreasing function of 
 the number of other animals sharing its territory, we show the 
 resultant game has a pure strategy Nash equilibrium (PSNE). 
 Furthermore, this PSNE is generated via "natural" myopic behavior on 
 the part of the animals.
  
 Finally, we compare this type of game with congestion games and 
 potential games.

Title: The Topological Structure of Maximal Lattice Free Convex Bodies: 
 The General Case
Abstract: Given a generic m x n matrix A, the 
 simplicial complex {bold K}(A) is defined to be the collection of 
 simplices representing maximal lattice point free convex bodies of 
 the form {x : Ax <= b}. The main result of this paper is that the 
 topological space associated with {bold K}(A) is homeomorphic with 
 R^{m-1}.

Title: Edgeworth Approximation for MINPIN Estimators in Semiparametric 
 Regression Models 
Abstract: We examine the higher order asymptotic properties of 
 semiparametric regression estimators that were obtained by the 
 general MINPIN method described in Andrews (1989). We derive an 
 order n^{-1} stochastic expansion and give a theorem justifying order 
 n^{-1} distributional approximation of the Edgeworth type.

Title: Error Bands for Impulse Responses 
Abstract: We examine the theory and behavior in practice of Bayesian 
 and bootstrap methods for generating error bands on impulse responses 
 in dynamic linear models. The Bayesian intervals have a firmer 
 theoretical foundation in small samples, are easier to compute, and 
 are about as good in small samples by classical criteria as are the 
 best bootstrap intervals. Bootstrap intervals based directly on the 
 simulated small-sample distribution of an estimator, without bias 
 correction, perform very badly. We show that a method that has been 
 used to extend to the overidentified case standard algorithms for 
 Bayesian intervals in reduced form models is incorrect, and we show 
 how to obtain correct Bayesian intervals for this case.

Title: Model Determination and Macroeconomic Activity 
Abstract: The subject of this paper is modelling, estimation, inference 
 and prediction for economic time series. Bayesian and classical 
 approaches are considered. The paper has three main parts. The first 
 is concerned with Bayesian model determination, forecast evaluation 
 and the construction of evolving sequences of models that can adapt 
 in dimension and form (including the way in which any nonstationarity 
 in the data is modelled) as new characteristics in the data become 
 evident. This part of the paper continues some recent work on Bayesian 
 asymptotics by the author and Werner Ploberger, develops embedding 
 techniques for vector martingales that justify the role of a general 
 class of exponential densities in model selection and forecast 
 evaluation, and implements the modelling ideas in a multivariate 
 regression framework that includes Bayesian vector autoregressions 
 (BVAR's) and reduced rank regressions (RRR's). It is shown how the 
 theory in the paper can be used: (i) to construct optimized BVAR's 
 with data- determined hyperparameters; (ii) to compare models such as 
 BVAR's, optimized BVAR's and RRR's; (iii) to perform joint order 
 selection of cointegrating rank, lag length and trend degree in a 
 VAR; and (iv) to discard data that may be irrelevant and thereby help 
 determine the "lifetime" of an econometric model. Simulations are 
 conducted to study the forecasting performance of these model 
 determination procedures in some multiple time series models with 
 cointegration. The final part of the paper reports an empirical 
 application of these ideas and methods to US and UK macroeconomic 
 data.

Title: Fully Modified IV, GIVE and GMM Estimation with Possibly 
 Non-Stationary Regressions and Instruments 
Abstract: This paper develops a general theory of instrumental variables 
 (IV) estimation that allows for both I(1) and I(0) regressors and 
 instruments. The estimation techniques involve an extension of the 
 fully modified (FM) regression procedure that was introduced in 
 earlier work by Phillips-Hansen (1990). FM versions of the generalized 
 instrumental variable estimation (GIVE) method and the generalized 
 method of moments (GMM) estimator are developed. In models with both 
 stationary and nonstationary components, the FM-GIVE and FM-GMM 
 techniques provide efficiency gains over FM-IV in the estimation of 
 the stationary components of a model that has both stationary and 
 nonstationary regressors. The paper exploits a result of Phillips 
 (1991a) that we can apply FM techniques in models with cointegrated 
 regressors and even in stationary regression models without losing the 
 method's good asymptotic properties. The present paper shows how to 
 take advantage jointly of the good asymptotic properties of FM 
 estimators with respect to the nonstationary elements of a model and 
 the good asymptotic properties of the GIVE and GMM estimators with 
 respect to the stationary components. The theory applies even when 
 there is no prior knowledge of the number of unit roots in the system 
 or the dimension or the location of the cointegration space. An FM 
 extension of the Sargan (1958) test for the validity of the 
 instruments is proposed. 
Keywords: Cointegration, fully modified least squares; GIVE, GMM, 
 instrument validity, long run covariance, semiparametric correction, 
 unit roots

Title: Robust Tests of Forward Exchange Market Efficiency with 
 Empirical Evidence from the 1920's 
Abstract: This paper provides a robust statistical approach to testing 
 the unbiasedness hypothesis in forward exchange market efficiency 
 studies. The methods we use allow us to work explicitly with levels 
 rather than differenced data. They are statistically robust to data 
 distributions with heavy tails, and they can be applied to data sets 
 where the frequency of observation and the futures maturity do not 
 coincide. In addition, our methods allow for stochastic trend 
 nonstationarity and general forms of serial dependence. The methods 
 are applied to daily data of spot exchange rates and forward exchange 
 rates during the 1920's, which marked the first episode of a broadly 
 general floating exchange rate system. The tail behavior of the data 
 is analyzed using an adaptive data-based method for estimating the 
 tail slope of the density. The results confirm the need for the use 
 of robust regression methods. We find cointegration between the 
 forward rate and spot rate for the four currencies we consider (the 
 Belgian and French francs, the Italian lira and the US dollar, all 
 measured against the British pound), we find support for a stationary 
 risk premium in the case of the Belgian franc, the Italian lira and 
 the US dollar, and we find support for the simple market efficiency 
 hypothesis (where the forward rate is an unbiased predictor of the 
 future spot rate and there is a zero mean risk premium) in the case 
 of the US dollar.

Title: Locational Competition and the Environment: Should Countries 
 Harmonize Their Environmental Policies? 
Abstract: In debates about economic unification or trade liberalization, 
 it is often asked whether harmonization should go beyond taxes and 
 macroeconomic policies to include regulations, particularly 
 environmental policy. This issue also arises when countries, states, 
 and cities engage in competition for plants, jobs, or exports in 
 what we might call "locational competition." This essay analyzes 
 locational competition with particular reference to environmental 
 policy. The conclusions are the following: First, economic efficiency 
 requires harmonization of policies for global environmental issues; 
 second, for local public goods or externalities, there is a strong 
 presumptive case against harmonization; and finally that a competitive 
 "race to the bottom" in environmental policies is inconsistent with 
 countries' following their own economic self-interests.

Title: Do Real Output and Real Wage Measures Capture Reality? The 
 History of Lighting Suggests Not 
Abstract: Historical studies of the growth in real wages and output 
 depend upon the accurate measure of the price trends of goods and 
 services. Over long periods of time, the consumption bundle has 
 changed profoundly, and most of today's consumption includes items 
 that were not produced, and in some cases not even conceived, at the 
 beginning of the nineteenth century. This paper tackles the issue of 
 the quantitative significance of the qualitative change in consumption 
 by choosing a single service -- lighting -- for which the service 
 characteristic -- illumination -- is invariant. We estimate changes in 
 lighting efficiency and construct a "true" price index back to 
 Babylonian times, with the major emphasis on changes over the last two 
 centuries. A comparison of the true price of light with a traditional 
 light price indicates that traditional price indexes overstate price 
 growth, and therefore understate output growth, by a factor between 
 900 and 1,600 since the beginning of the nineteenth century. This 
 finding suggests that the "true" growth of real wages and real output 
 may have been significantly understated during the period since the 
 Industrial Revolution.

Title: Testing for Serial Correlation Against an ARMA(1,1) Process 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with tests for serial correlation in 
 time series and in the errors of regression models. In particular, 
 the nonstandard problem of testing for white noise against ARMA(1,1) 
 alternatives is considered. Sup Lagrange multiplier (LM) and 
 exponential average LM tests are introduced and are shown to be 
 asymptotically admissible for ARMA(1,1) alternatives. In addition, 
 they are shown to be consistent against all (weakly stationary strong 
 mixing) non-white noise alternatives. Simulation results compare the 
 tests to several tests in the literature. These results show that the 
 Exp-LM_{infinity} test has very good all-around power properties.

Title: Insurance Market Games: Scale Effects and Public Policy 
Abstract: We propose a game-theoretic model to study various effects 
 of scale in an insurance market. After reviewing a simple static 
 model, we present a one-period game in which both the buyers and 
 sellers of insurance make strategic bids, and show that, under 
 reasonably broad conditions, market equilibrium exists. For a special 
 case, we then consider how both the price and quantity of insurance, 
 as well as other quantities of interest to public policy decision 
 makers, are affected by the number of insurance firms, the number of 
 customers, and the total amount of capital provided by investors.

Title: Local Nonlinear Least Squares Estimation: Using Parametric 
 Information Nonparametrically 
Abstract: We introduce a new kernel smoother for nonparametric 
 regression that uses prior information on regression shape in the 
 form of a parametric model. In effect, we nonparametrically encompass 
 the parametric model. We derive pointwise and uniform consistency and 
 the asymptotic distribution of our procedure. It has superior 
 performance to the usual kernel estimators at or near the parametric 
 model. It is particularly well motivated for binary data using the 
 probit or logit parametric model as a base. We include an application 
 to the Horowitz (1993) transport choice dataset.

Title: Home Equity Insurance 
Abstract: Home equity insurance policies, policies insuring homeowners 
 against declines in the price of their homes, would bear some 
 resemblance both to ordinary insurance and to financial hedging 
 vehicles. A menu of choices for the design of such policies is 
 presented here, and conceptual issues are discussed. Choices include 
 pass-through futures and options, in which the insurance company in 
 effect serves as a retailer to homeowners of short positions in real 
 estate futures markets or of put options on real estate. Another 
 choice is a life-event-triggered insurance policy, in which the 
 homeowner pays regular fixed insurance premia and is entitled to a 
 claim if both there is a sufficient decline in the real estate price 
 index and a specified life event (such as a move beyond a certain 
 geographical distance) occurs. Pricing of the premia to cover loss 
 experience is derived, and tables of break-even policy premia are 
 shown, based on estimated models of Los Angeles housing prices 1971-91.

Title: Health Care Reform as Seen by a General Economist 
Abstract: Universal coverage, it is argued, implies universally 
 required insurance, to avoid adverse selection into last-resort care 
 implicitly guaranteed. It also entails community rating, such that 
 insurers cannot choose among risks. Individual mandate makes more 
 sense than employer mandate. A system is proposed in which individual 
 can choose among a government Medicare-like plan and private insurance 
 offering equivalent services. Means-tested assistance would help 
 individuals pay premiums.

Title: Ponzi Finance, Government Solvency and the Redundancy or 
 Usefulness of Public Debt 
Abstract: We study how the government's ability to borrow depends on 
 its capacity to tax. Using a two-period OLG growth model, we 
 establish the following.
  
 When lump-sum taxes are unrestricted, Ponzi finance is possible, 
 regardless of whether the economy is dynamically inefficient and 
 regardless of the relationship between the interest rate and the 
 growth rate. Ponzi finance, and government debt generally, is 
 unessential or redundant: it does not enlarge the set of allocations 
 that can be supported as competitive equilibria.
  
 When lump-sum taxes are restricted, Ponzi finance (public debt) may 
 be essential.
  
 Central to the paper is our characterization of feasible government 
 fiscal-financial plans for an infinite-lived government facing a 
 sequence of finite-lived overlapping private generations. The central 
 idea is that the government does not bankrupt private agents. We 
 contrast our criterion with the conventional government solvency 
 constraint. The conventional solvency constraint (the present value 
 of future government debt is non-positive in the infinitely distant 
 future) is neither necessary nor sufficient for our feasibility 
 criterion. When the government must use distortionary taxes and the 
 long-run interest rate exceeds the long-run growth rate, our 
 feasibility criterion implies the conventional solvency constraint.

Title: Applied Nonparametric Methods 
Abstract: We review different approaches to nonparametric density and 
 regression estimation. Kernel estimators are motivated from local 
 averaging and solving ill-posed problems. Kernel estimators are 
 compared to k-NN estimators, orthogonal series and splines. Pointwise 
 and uniform confidence bands are described, and the choice of 
 smoothing parameter is discussed. Finally, the method is applied to 
 nonparametric prediction of time series and to semiparametric 
 estimation.

Title: The Allocation of Resources in the Presence of Indivisibilities 
Abstract: The pricing tests for optimality in a convex programming 
 problem are not available when the production possibility set displays 
 economies of scale. The paper argues that indivisibilities in 
 production are one of the major causes of such economies. The 
 constrained optimization problems arising in the presence of 
 indivisibilities are integer programs, and it is proposed that the 
 unique, minimal quantity tests for such problems may shed some light 
 on the internal organization of a large firm.

Title: Marching to Different Drummers: Coordination and Independence 
 in Monetary and Fiscal Policies 
Abstract: Most countries have recently experienced high fiscal deficits 
 and real interest rates that depressed national saving and slowed 
 economic growth. This study analyzes the reasons that underlie the 
 skewed fiscal-monetary mix. The first section develops a 
 game-theoretic model of fiscal and monetary coordination and shows 
 that the macroeconomic outcomes depend upon the degree of coordination 
 or independence. The second section applies this approach to the 
 Clinton package by using three macroeconomic models to estimate the 
 likely macroeconomic impacts of different degrees of coordination. 
 The paper concludes that an uncoordinated policy may lead to 
 substantial loss of output that will not be offset by higher potential 
 output growth for many years. This implies that the potential gains 
 from coordination are extremely high.

Title: A Limit Theorem for a Smooth Class of Semiparametric Estimators 
Abstract: We consider an econometric model based on a set of moment 
 conditions which are indexed by both a finite dimensional parameter 
 vector of interest, and an infinite dimensional parameter, h, which 
 in turn depends upon both and another infinite dimensional parameter, 
 tau. The model assumes that the moment conditions equal zero at the 
 true value of all unknown parameters. Estimators of are obtained by 
 forming nonparametric estimates of h and tau, substituting them into 
 the sample analog of the moment conditions, and choosing that value 
 of that makes the sample moments as "close as possible" to zero. 
 Using independence and smoothness assumptions the paper provides 
 consistency, root{n} consistency, and asymptotic normality proofs 
 for the resultant estimator. As an example, we consider Olley and 
 Pakes' (1991) use of semiparametric techniques to control for both 
 simultaneity and selection biases in estimating production functions. 
 This example illustrates how semiparametric techniques can be used to 
 overcome both computational problems, and the need for strong 
 functional form restrictions, in obtaining estimates from structural 
 models. We also provide two additional sets of empirical results for 
 this example. First we compare the estimators of theta obtained using 
 different estimators for the nonparametric components of the problem, 
 and then we compare alternative estimators for the estimated standard 
 errors of those estimators.

Title: Second Order Approximation in the Partially Linear Regression 
 Model 
Abstract: We examine the second order properties of various quantities 
 of interest in the partially linear regression model. We obtain a 
 stochastic expansion with remainder o_{P}(n^{-2mu}), where mu < 1/2, 
 for the standardized semiparametric least squares estimator, a 
 standard error estimator, and a studentized statistic. We use the 
 second order expansions to correct the standard error estimates for 
 second order effects, and to define a method of bandwidth choice. A 
 Monte Carlo experiment provides favorable evidence on our method of 
 bandwidth choice.

Title: Robust Nonstationary Regression 
Abstract: This paper provides a robust statistical approach to 
 nonstationary time series regression and inference. Fully modified 
 extensions of traditional robust statistical procedures are developed 
 which allow for endogeneities in the nonstationary regressors and 
 serial dependence in the shocks that drive the regressors and the 
 errors that appear in the equation being estimated. The suggested 
 estimators involve semiparametric corrections to accommodate these 
 possibilities and they belong to the same family as the fully modified 
 least squares (FM-OLS) estimator of Phillips and Hansen (1990). 
 Specific attention is given to fully modified least absolute deviation 
 (FM-LAD) estimation and fully modified M (FM-M)-estimation. The 
 criterion function for LAD and some M-estimators is not always smooth 
 and the paper develops generalized function methods to cope with this 
 difficulty in the asymptotics. The results given here include a strong 
 law of large numbers and some weak convergence theory for partial sums 
 of generalized functions of random variables. The limit distribution 
 theory for FM-LAD and FM-M estimators that is developed includes the 
 case of finite variance errors and the case of heavy-tailed (infinite 
 variance) errors. Some simulations and a brief empirical illustration 
 are reported. 
Keywords: FM-LAD estimator, FM-M estimator, generalized functions of 
 random variables, laws of large numbers and weak convergence for 
 generalized functions, non-Gaussian nonstationarity, regular sequence, 
 robust estimation

Title: Macroeconomic Shocks in an Aggregative Disequilibrium Model 
Abstract: In this paper, I first show how aggregation over submarkets 
 that exhibit varying degrees of disequilibrium can provide a 
 foundation to the classic "short-side" disequilibrium econometric 
 model of Fair and Jaffee [11]. I then introduce explicit randomness 
 in the aggregative model as arising from economy-wide demand and 
 supply shocks, which are allowed to be serially correlated. I develop 
 suitable simulation estimation methods to circumvent hitherto 
 intractable computational problems resulting from serial correlation 
 in the unobservables in disequilibrium analysis. I show that the 
 introduction of macroeconomic shocks has fundamentally different 
 implications compared to the traditional approach that arbitrarily 
 appends an additive disturbance term to the basic equation of the 
 model.
  
 The aggregative disequilibrium model with macroeconomic shocks is 
 estimated from a set of quarterly observations on the labor market in 
 US manufacturing. A major finding is that the introduction of 
 macroeconomic shocks is able to explain a large part of the residual 
 serial correlation that was plaguing traditional studies. Moreover, 
 the new modelling technique yields considerably more satisfactory 
 estimates of the supply side of the markets.

Title: Common Knowledge 
Abstract: This paper surveys the implications of "common knowledge" in 
 interactive epistemology and game theory, with special emphasis on 
 speculation, betting, agreeing to disagree, and coordination. The 
 implications of approximate common knowledge are also analyzed. 
 Approximate common knowledge is defined three ways: as knowledge of 
 knowledge ... of knowledge, iterated N times; as p-common knowledge; 
 and as weak p-common knowledge. Finally the implications of common 
 knowledge are examined when agents are boundedly rational.

Title: The Natural Rate as New Classical Macroeconomics -- For Rod 
 Cross, The Natural Rate Hypothesis 25 Years On 
Abstract: Friedman identified his "natural rate" as Walrasian 
 equilibrium. Keynes's "full employment" is also classical equilibrium: 
 labor markets are clearing at existing real wages. Why is equilibrium 
 unemployment not zero? Keynes and Friedman cite, but do not explain, 
 "frictional" unemployment. They differ on what explains cycles. 
 Friedman and Lucas answer: misperceptions of inflation. Markets clear 
 at wrong prices and quantities. Today New Classicals stress variations 
 in the natural rate itself. In Keynesian cycles markets don't clear. 
 Excess supplies or demands trigger Phillips-curve movements of wages 
 and prices. Unemployment and vacancies coexist in varying proportions 
 because inter-sectoral shocks always occur. Adjustment dynamics, not 
 representative-agent equilibria, determine the economy's behavior at 
 NAIRU and other unemployment rates. Money makes a difference, not 
 because of money illusions or misperceptions but because adjustments 
 begin with nominal wage and price responses.

Title: Hypothesis Testing with a Restricted Parameter Space 
Abstract: This paper considers hypothesis tests for nonlinear 
 econometric models when the parameter space is restricted under the 
 alternative hypothesis. Multivariate one-sided tests are a leading 
 example. Asymptotically optimal tests are derived using a weighted 
 average power criterion. In addition, the likelihood ratio test is 
 shown to be asymptotically admissible and to maximize asymptotic 
 power against alternatives that are arbitrarily distant from the 
 null hypothesis. For Gaussian linear regression models with known 
 variance, analogous exact finite sample results are established.

Title: Empirical Process Methods in Econometrics 
Abstract: This paper provides an introduction to the use of empirical 
 process methods in econometrics. These methods can be used to 
 establish the large sample properties of econometric estimators and 
 test statistics. In the first part of the paper, key terminology and 
 results are introduced and discussed heuristically. Applications in 
 the econometrics literature are briefly reviewed. A select set of 
 three classes of applications is discussed in more detail. 
  
 The second part of the paper shows how one can verify a key property 
 called stochastic equicontinuity. The paper takes several stochastic 
 equicontinuity results from the probability literature, which rely on 
 entropy conditions of one sort or another, and provides primitive 
 sufficient conditions under which the entropy conditions hold. This 
 yields stochastic equicontinuity results that are readily applicable 
 in a variety of contexts. Examples are provided.

Abstract: This paper establishes the asymptotic admissibility of the 
 likelihood ratio (LR) test for a general class of testing problems in 
 which a nuisance parameter is present only under the alternative 
 hypothesis. The paper also establishes the finite sample admissibility 
 of the LR test for testing problems of this sort that arise in 
 Gaussian linear regression models with known variance.

Title: A Simulation Estimation Analysis of the External Debt Crises 
 of Developing Countries 
Abstract: In this paper I develop models of the incidence and extent 
 of external financing crises of developing countries, which lead to 
 multiperiod multinomial discrete choice and discrete/continuous 
 econometric specifications with flexible correlation structures in 
 the unobservables. I show that estimation of these models based on 
 simulation methods has attractive statistical properties and is 
 computationally tractable. Three such simulation estimation methods 
 are exposited, analyzed theoretically, and used in practice: a method 
 of smoothly simulation maximum likelihood (SSML) based on a smooth 
 recursive conditioning simulator (SRC), a method of simulated scores 
 (MSS) based on a Gibbs sampling simulator (GSS), and an MSS estimator 
 based on the SRC simulator. 
  
 The data set used in this study comprises 93 developing countries 
 observed through the 1970-1988 period and contains information on 
 external financing responses that are not available to investigators 
 in the past. Moreover, previous studies of external debt problems had 
 to rely on restrictive correlation structures in the unobservables to 
 overcome otherwise intractable computational difficulties. The 
 findings show that being able for the first time to allow for flexible 
 correlation patterns in the unobservables through estimation by 
 simulation has a substantial impact on the parameter estimates 
 obtained from such models. This suggests that past empirical results

Title: Forward Exchange Market Unbiasedness: The Case of the 
 Australian Dollar Since 1984 
Abstract: This paper implements a new statistical approach to robust 
 regression with nonstationary time series. The methods are presently 
 under theoretical development in other work, and are briefly exposited 
 here. They allow us to perform regressions in levels with 
 nonstationary time series data, they accommodate data distributions 
 with heavy tails and they permit serial dependence and temporal 
 heterogeneity of unknown form in the equation errors. With these 
 features the methods are well suited to applications with frequently 
 sampled exchange rate data, which generally display all of these 
 empirical characteristics. Our application is to daily data on spot 
 and forward exchange rates between the Australian and US dollars over 
 the period 1984-1991 following the deregulation of the Australian 
 foreign exchange market. We find big differences between the robust 
 and the non-robust regression outcomes and in the associated 
 statistical tests of the hypothesis that the forward rate is an 
 unbiased predictor of the future spot rate. The robust regression 
 tests reject the unbiasedness hypothesis but still give the forward 
 rate an important role as a predictor of the future spot rate.

Title: Adaptive Estimation in ARCH Models 
Abstract: We construct efficient estimators of the identifiable 
 parameters in a regression model when the errors follow a stationary 
 parametric ARCH(P) process. We do not assume a functional form for the 
 conditional density of the errors, but do require that it be symmetric 
 about zero. The estimators of the mean parameters are adaptive in the 
 sense of Bickel [2]. The ARCH parameters are not jointly identifiable 
 with the error density. We consider a reparameterization of the 
 variance process and show that the identifiable parameters of this 
 process are adaptively estimable.

Title: Nonlinear Econometric Models with Deterministically Trending 
 Variables 
Abstract: This paper considers an alternative asymptotic framework to 
 standard sequential asymptotics for nonlinear models with 
 deterministically trending variables. The asymptotic distributions of 
 generalized method of moments estimators and corresponding test 
 statistics are derived using this framework. The asymptotic 
 distributions are shown to be the same with deterministically trending 
 variables as with non-trending variables. That is, the distributions 
 are normal and chi-squared respectively. The asymptotic covariance 
 matrices of the estimators, however, are found to depend on the form 
 of the trends. These findings provide a justification for the use of 
 standard asymptotic approximations in nonlinear models even when the 
 variables have deterministic trends.

Title: On the Sources and Significance of Interindustry Differences in 
 Technological Opportunities 
Abstract: The set of technological opportunities in a given industry is 
 one of the fundamental determinants of technical advance in that line 
 of business. We examine the concept of technological opportunity and 
 discuss three categories of sources of those opportunities: advances 
 in scientific understanding and technique, technological advances 
 originating in other industries and in other private and governmental 
 institutions, and feedbacks from an industry's own technological 
 advances. Data from the Yale Survey on Industrial Research and 
 Development are used to measure the strength of various sources of 
 technological opportunity and to discern interindustry differences in 
 the importance of these sources. We find that interindustry 
 differences in the strength and sources of technological opportunities 
 contribute importantly to explanations of cross-industry variation in 
 R&D intensity and technological advance.

Title: Classical Estimation Methods for LDV Models Using Simulation 
Abstract: This paper discusses estimation methods for limited dependent 
 variable (LDV) models that employ Monte Carlo simulation techniques to 
 overcome computational problems in such models. These difficulties 
 take the form of high dimensional integrals that need to be calculated 
 repeatedly but cannot be easily approximated by series expansions. In 
 the past, investigators were forced to restrict attention to special 
 classes of LDV models that are computationally manageable. The 
 simulation estimation methods we discuss here make it possible to 
 estimate LDV models that are computationally intractable using 
 classical estimation methods.
  
 We first review the ways in which LDV models arise, describing the 
 differences and similarities in censored and truncated data generating 
 processes. Censoring and truncation give rise to the troublesome 
 multivariate integrals. Following the LDV models, we described various 
 simulation methods for evaluating such integrals. Naturally, censoring 
 and truncation play roles in simulation as well. Finally, estimation 
 methods that rely on simulation are described. We review three general 
 approaches that combine estimation of LDV models and simulation: 
 simulation of the log-likelihood function (MLS), simulation of moment 
 functions (MSM), and simulation of the score (MSS). The MSS is a 
 combination of ideas from MSL and MSM, treading the efficient score 
 of the log-likelihood function as a moment function.
  
 We use the rank ordered probit model as an illustrative example to 
 investigate the comparative properties of these simulation estimation 
 approaches. 
Keywords: Multivariate integration, limited dependent variable models, 
 Monte Carlo simulation, maximum simulated likelihood, method of

Title: The Money Rate of Interest and the Influence of Assets in a 
 Multistage Economy with Gold or Paper Money: Part II 
Abstract: We consider the relationship between the length of life of 
 individuals and the assets they own and their influence on trustless 
 trade. In particular in some structures a role for government or an 
 outside bank may be called for to support an equilibrium. An example 
 of an OLG model with production illustrates the need for expanding the 
 fiat money supply if population growth is greater than zero.

Title: Simulating Normal Rectangle Probabilities and Their Derivatives: 
 The Effects of Vectorization 
Abstract: An extensive literature in econometrics and in numerical 
 analysis has considered the computationally difficult problem of 
 evaluating the multiple integral representing the probability of a 
 multivariate normal random vector constrained to lie in a rectangular 
 region. A leading case of such an integral is the negative orthant 
 probability, implied by the multinomial probit (MNP) model used in 
 econometrics and biometrics. Classical parametric estimation of this 
 model requires, for each trial parameter vector and each observation 
 in a sample, evaluation of a normal orthant probability and its 
 derivatives with respect to the mean vector and the variance-covariance
 matrix. Several Monte Carlo simulators have been developed to
 approximate the orthant probability integral and its linear and
 logarithmic derivatives that limit computation while possessing
 properties that facilitate their use in iterative calculations for
 statistical inference. In this paper, I discuss Gauss and FORTRAN
 implementations of 13 simulation algorithms, and I present results on
 the impact of vectorization on the relative computational performance
 of the simulation algorithms. I show that the 13 simulators differ
 greatly with respect to the degree of vectorizability: in some cases
 activating the CRAY-Y/MP4 vector facility achieves a speed-up factor
 in excess of 10 times, while in others the gains in speed are
 negligible. Evaluating the algorithms in terms of lowest simulation
 root-mean-squared-error for given computation time, I find that (1)
 GHK, an importance sampling recursive triangularization simulator,
 remains the best method for simulating probabilities irrespective of
 vectorization; (2) the crude Monte Carlo simulator CFS offers the
 greatest benefits from vectorization; and (3) the GSS algorithm, based
 on "Gibbs resampling," emerges as one of the preferred methods for
 simulating logarithmic derivatives, especially in the absence of
 vectorization.

Title: Aggregate Income Risks and Hedging Mechanisms 
Abstract: Estimates are made, from time series data on real gross 
 domestic products, of the standard deviations of returns in markets 
 for perpetual claims on countries' incomes. The results indicate that 
 the variability of returns is of a magnitude comparable to that of 
 returns in stock markets. Evidence is shown that there may be only 
 minimal possibility of cross hedging these returns in existing 
 capital markets.
  
 Methods of establishing markets for perpetual claims on aggregate 
 incomes are examined. Such markets, by allowing hedging of these 
 aggregate income risks, might make for dramatically more effective 
 international macroeconomic risk sharing than is possible today. 
 Retail institutions are described that might develop around such 
 markets and help the public with their risk management. However, the 
 establishment of such markets would also incur the risk of major 
 financial bubbles and panics.

Title: Fully Modified Least Squares and Vector Autoregression 
Abstract: Fully modified least squares (FM-OLS) regression was 
 originally designed in work by Phillips and Hansen (1990) to provide 
 optimal estimates of cointegrating regressions. The method modifies 
 least squares to account for serial correlation effects and for the 
 endogeneity in the regressors that results from the existence of a 
 cointegrating relationship. This paper provides a general framework 
 which makes it possible to study the asymptotic behavior of FM-OLS in 
 models with full rank I(1) regressors, models with I(1) and I(0) 
 regressors, models with unit roots, and models with only stationary 
 regressors. This framework enables us to consider the use of FM 
 regression in the context of vector autoregressions (VAR's) with some 
 unit roots and some cointegrating relations. The resulting FM-VAR 
 regressions are shown to have some interesting properties. For 
 example, when there is some cointegration in the system, FM-VAR 
 estimation has a limit theory that is normal for all of the stationary 
 coefficients and mixed normal for all of the nonstationary 
 coefficients. Thus, there are no unit root limit distributions even in 
 the case of the unit root coefficient submatrix (i.e., I_{n-r}, for an 
 n-dimensional VAR with r cointegrating vectors). Moreover, optimal 
 estimation of the cointegration space is attained in FM-VAR regression 
 without prior knowledge of the number of unit roots in the system, 
 without pretesting to determine the dimension of the cointegration 
 space and without the use of restricted regression techniques like 
 reduced rank regression. 
  
 The paper also develops an asymptotic theory for inference based on 
 FM-OLS and FM-VAR regression. The limit theory for Wald tests that 
 rely on the FM estimator is shown to involve a linear combination of 
 independent chi-squared variates. This limit distribution is bounded 
 above by the conventional chi-squared distribution with degrees of 
 freedom equal to the number of restrictions. Thus, conventional 
 critical values can be used to construct valid (but conservative) 
 asymptotic tests in quite general FM time series regressions. This 
 theory applies to causality testing in VAR's and is therefore 
 potentially useful in empirical applications. 
Keywords: Causality testing, cointegration, fully modified regression, 
 fully modified vector autoregression, hyperconsistency, long-run 
 covariance matrix, one-sided long-run covariance matrix, some unit

Title: The Money Rate of Interest and the Influence of Assets in a 
 Multistage Economy with Gold or Paper Money: Part I 
Abstract: The role of long lived assets is considered in serving as 
 hostages to extend the domain of trustless trade in an exchange 
 economy. Assuming that individuals have life cycle preferences, we 
 consider the most general set of utility functions consistent with 
 these preferences and a stationary equilibrium for an OLG economy. 
 The influence of the type of asset, durable or storable on the need 
 for money is considered.

Title: Measuring the Impact of Global Warming in Agriculture 
Abstract: This paper develops a "Ricardian" approach for measuring 
 the economic impact of environmental factors such as climate by 
 examining the direct impact of the environmental factor on land 
 prices. Estimating the model using cross-sectional data on climate, 
 farm-land prices, and other economic and geophysical data for almost 
 3,000 countries in the United States, we find that higher temperatures 
 in all seasons except autumn reduce average farm values in the United 
 States and more precipitation in all seasons except autumn increases 
 farm values. Applying the model to a global-warming scenario finds 
 a range of impacts depending upon whether the model emphasize the 
 grains through crop-land weights or a broader set of crops through 
 crop-revenue weights. The results of the Ricardian approach show a 
 significantly lower estimated impact of global warming than the 
 traditional production-function approach.

Title: Behavioral Heterogeneity and Cournot Oligopoly Equilibrium 
Abstract: It is not infrequent to see studies of imperfect competition 
 or of industrial organization rest upon questionable foundations such 
 as the hypothesis that inverse market demand is, whenever it is 
 positive, concave or even linear. Assumptions of this sort are not 
 robust (i.e., "additive") in the sense that they are not usually 
 preserved through aggregation of different sectors that would satisfy 
 them individually. The present paper investigates an alternative 
 specification that is based upon the plausible existence of 
 significant heterogeneities among demanders. It is demonstrated that 
 specific forms of demand heterogeneity tend to stabilize market 
 expenditures. In a partial equilibrium context, sufficient demand 
 heterogeneity is shown to imply existence and unicity of a Cournot 
 oligopoly equilibrium.

Title: A Strategic Market Game with Seigniorage Costs of Fiat Money 
Abstract: A model that includes the cost of producing money is 
 presented and the nature of the inefficient equilibria in the model 
 are examined. It is suggested that if one acknowledges that 
 transactions are a form of production, which requires the consumption 
 resources, then the concept of Pareto optimality is inappropriate for 
 assessing efficiency. Instead it becomes necessary to provide an 
 appropriate comparative analysis of alternative transactions 
 mechanisms in the appropriate context.

Title: An Old Keynesian Counterattacks 
Abstract: Both New Classical and New Keynesian macroeconomic theorists 
 misunderstand and distort old Keynesian economics, alleging that its 
 diagnoses and prescriptions depend on the indefensible assumption that 
 money wages and prices are "rigid." Here it is argued that all 
 Keynesian macro requires is that labor and product markets are not 
 instantaneously and continuously cleared by perfectly flexible prices. 
 Assuming imperfect flexibility, not necessarily rigidity, suffices to 
 open the door for involuntary unemployment. Moreover, once the economy 
 is displaced from full employment, it is far from clear that 
 economy-wide movements of money wages and prices will, in the absence 
 of Keynesian demand policies, restore equilibrium. The real balance 
 effect is too feeble, and may be overcome by debt burdens. The 
 processes of deflation and disinflation can be inherently 
 destabilizing. These problems, stressed by Irving Fisher as well as 
 by Keynes and Keynesians, are ignored in "new" macroeconomics.

Title: An Alternative Theory of Firm and Industry Dynamics 
Abstract: This paper provides a model of firm and industry dynamics 
 that allows for entry, exit and firm-specific uncertainty generating 
 variability in the fortunes of firms. It focuses on the impact of 
 uncertainty arising from investment in research and exploration-type 
 processes. It analyzes the behavior of individual firms exploring 
 profit opportunities in an evolving marketplace and derives optimal 
 policies, including exit, in this environment. Then it adds an entry 
 process and aggregates the optimal behavior of all firms, including 
 potential entrants, into a rational expectations, Markov perfect 
 industry equilibrium, and proves ergodicity of the equilibrium 
 process. Numerical examples are used to illustrate the more detailed 
 characteristics of the stochastic process generating industry 
 structures that result from this equilibrium.

Title: Hyper-Consistent Estimation of a Unit Root in Time Series 
 Regression 
Abstract: It is shown that the fully modified ordinary least squares 
 (FM-OLS) estimator of a unit root in time series regression is 
 T^{3/2}-consistent. Relative to FM-OLS, therefore, the least squares 
 and maximum likelihood estimators are infinitely deficient 
 asymptotically. Simulations show that this dominance of FM-OLS 
 persists even in small samples.

Title: Some Exact Distribution Theory for Maximum Likelihood Estimators 
 of Cointegrating Coefficients in Error Correction Models 
Abstract: This paper derives some exact finite sample distributions and 
 characterizes the tail behavior of maximum likelihood estimators of 
 the cointegrating coefficients in error correction models. It is shown 
 that the reduced rank regression estimator has a distribution with 
 Cauchy-like tails and no finite moments of integer order. The maximum 
 likelihood estimator of the coefficients in a particular triangular 
 system representation is studied and shown to have matrix 
 t-distribution tails with finite integer moments to order T - n + r 
 where T is the sample size, n is the total number of variables in the 
 system and r is the dimension of the cointegration space. These 
 results help to explain some recent simulation studies where extreme 
 outliers are found to occur more frequently for the reduced rank 
 regression estimator than for alternative asymptotically efficient 
 procedures that are based on the triangular representation. In a 
 simple triangular system, the Wald statistic for testing linear 
 hypotheses about the columns of the cointegrating matrix is shown to 
 have an F distribution, analogous to Hotelling's T^{2} distribution in 
 multivariate linear  regression. 
Keywords: Hypergeometric function, invariant measure, matrix Cauchy, 
 maximum likelihood, orthogonal group, reduced rank regression,

Title: Time Series Modeling with a Bayesian Frame of Reference: 
 Concepts, Illustrations and Asymptotics 
Abstract: This paper offers an approach to time series modeling that 
 attempts to reconcile classical and Bayesian methods. The central idea 
 put forward to achieve this reconciliation is that the Bayesian 
 approach relies implicitly on a frame of reference for the data 
 generating mechanism that is quite different from the one that is 
 employed in the classical approach. Differences in inferences from the 
 two approaches are therefore to be expected unless the altered frame 
 of reference is taken into account. We show that the new frame of 
 reference in Bayesian inference is a consequence of a change of 
 measure that arises naturally in the application of Bayes theorem.
  
 Our paper explores this change of measure and its consequences using 
 martingale methods. Examples are given to illustrate its practical 
 implications. No assumptions concerning stationarity or rates of 
 convergence are required in the development of our asymptotic theory. 
 Some implications for statistical testing are explored and we suggest 
 new tests, which we call Bayes model tests, for discriminating between 
 models. A posterior odds version of these tests is developed and shown 
 to have good finite sample properties. This is the test that we 
 recommend for practical use. Autoregressive models with multiple lags 
 and deterministic trends are considered and explicit forms are given 
 for the posterior odds tests for the presence of a unit root and for 
 joint tests for the presence of a unit root, drift and trend.
  
 This paper emphasizes the new conceptual framework for thinking about 
 Bayesian methods in time series and provides illustrations of its use 
 in some common models for possibly nonstationary time series. A sequel 
 to the present paper develops a general and more abstract theory that 
 will have a wider range of applications. 
Keywords: Autoregression, Bayes model, Bayes measure, Bayes test, 
 Bayesian inference, data density process, Deleans exponential, 
 exponential Bayes measure, likelihood, martingale, posterior process,

Title: Some Dynamics of a Strategic Market Game with a Large Number of 
 Agents 
Abstract: This paper is designed to combine the game theoretic 
 investigation of the static or equilibrium properties of large 
 strategic market games together with the investigation of some very 
 simple dynamics, which nevertheless are sufficient to show differences 
 between two related games, one in which both borrowing and trade take 
 place. The role of banking reserves emerges as relevant and sensitive 
 to the transient state dynamics. Several 100,000 player games are 
 simulated and the behavior is constructed with the analytical 
 prediction for the games with a continuum of agents.

Title: Measuring Asset Values for Cash Settlement in Derivative 
 Markets: Hedonic Repeated Measures Indices and Perpetual Futures 
Abstract: Two proposals are made that may facilitate the creation of 
 derivative market instruments, such as futures contracts, cash-settled 
 based on economic indices. The first proposal concerns index number 
 construction: indices based on infrequent measurements of 
 nonstandardized items may control for quality change by using a 
 hedonic repeated measures method, an index number construction method 
 that follows individual assets or subjects through time and also takes 
 account of measured quality variables. The second proposal is to 
 establish markets for perpetual claims on cash flows matching indices 
 of dividends or rents. Such markets may help us to measure the prices 
 of the assets generating these dividends or rents even when the 
 underlying asset prices are difficult or impossible to observe 
 directly. A perpetual futures contract is proposed that would cash 
 settle every day in terms of both the change in the futures price and 
 the dividend or rent index for that day.

Title: The Large Sample Correspondence Between Classical Hypothesis 
 Tests and Bayesian Posterior Odds Tests 
Abstract: This paper establishes a correspondence in large samples 
 between classical hypothesis tests and Bayesian posterior odds tests 
 for models without trends. More specifically, tests of point null 
 hypotheses and one- or two-sided alternatives are considered (where 
 nuisance parameters may be present under both hypotheses). It is shown 
 that for certain priors the Bayesian posterior odds test is equivalent 
 in large samples to classical Wald, Lagrange multiplier, and likelihood 
 ratio tests for some significance level and vice versa.

Title: A Nine Variable Probabilistic Macroeconomic Forecasting Model 
Abstract: A model for U.S. macroeconomic time series that has been used 
 for forecasting for several years is described in some detail. The 
 model is a multivariate Bayesian autoregression, with allowance for 
 conditional heteroskedasticity, stochastic time-variation in 
 parameters, and non-normality of disturbances. It specifies the prior 
 distribution in ways that improve on previous Bayesian vector 
 autoregression specifications in realism and forecasting performance. 
 The model's record of forecasting in recent years is displayed and 
 discussed.

Title: Construction of Stationary Markov Equilibria in a Strategic 
 Market Game 
Abstract: This paper studies stationary noncooperative equilibria in 
 an economy with fiat money, one nondurable commodity, countably many 
 time periods, no credit or futures market, and a measure space of 
 agents -- who may differ in their preferences and in the distributions 
 of their (random) endowments. These agents are immortal, and hold fiat 
 money as a means of hedging against the random fluctuations in their 
 endowments of the commodity. In the aggregate, these fluctuations 
 offset each other, and equilibrium prices are constant. 
  
 We carry out an equilibrium analysis that focuses on distribution of 
 wealth, on consumption, and on price formation. A careful analysis of 
 the one-agent, infinite-horizon optimization problem, and of the 
 invariant measure for the associated optimally controlled Markov 
 chain, leads by aggregation to a stationary noncooperative or 
 competitive equilibrium. This consists of a price for the commodity 
 and of a distribution of wealth across agents which, under appropriate 
 simple strategies for the agents, stay fixed from period to period and 
 preserve the basic quantities of the model. 
  
 We hope that, in future work, we shall be able to address additional 
 features of the model treated here, such as borrowing and lending at 
 appropriate (endogenously determined) interest rates, the endogenous 
 production of the commodity, overlapping generations of agents, and 
 bankruptcy and treatment of creditors.

Title: The Complex of Maximal Lattice Free Simplices 
Abstract: The simplicial complex K(A) is defined to be the collection 
 of simplices, and their proper subsimplices, representing maximal 
 lattice free bodies of the form {x : Ax <= b}, with A a fixed (n + 1) 
 x n matrix. The topological space associated with K(A) is shown to be 
 homeomorphic to R^{n}, and the space obtained by identifying lattice 
 translates of these simplices is homeomorphic to the n-torus.

Title: Is Gold an Efficient Store of Value? 
Abstract: Gold and tobacco have both been used as commodity money. One 
 difference between the two is that gold yields utility, on account of 
 its beauty, without diminishing its quantity. Tobacco yields utility 
 when it is consumed. If this were the only difference, which would be 
 the better money?

Title: Poverty in Relation to Macroeconomic Trends, Cycles, and Policies 
Abstract: This survey concludes that general prosperity and economic 
 growth have been considerably less powerful engines of progress 
 against poverty in the U.S. than they were before 1973. Macroeconomic 
 performance has deteriorated, and its relation to poverty has weakened 
 too. It is shown that the incidence of poverty can be fairly well 
 explained by regressions on unemployment rates and real wages, both in 
 national time series and in state cross-sections. Recent downward 
 deviations from these regressions appear to reflect structural labor 
 market changes that make poverty less treatable by macro medicine.

Title: On the Periodic Structure of the Business Cycle 
Abstract: In this paper, we test whether a regime shift from expansion 
 to recession and vice versa is, ceteris paribus, equally likely 
 throughout the year. If not, then it may, for instance, be less likely 
 to get out of a recession in the middle of the winter than it is, say, 
 in the spring or summer. We make use of Markov switching regime models 
 to test the hypothesis of interest. The evidence is based on the 
 conventional NBER business cycle chronology as well as alternatives to 
 it. We find that recessions exhibit a periodic pattern in their 
 switching regime transition probability structure. It is particularly 
 the months associated with Christmas and spring that appear to have 
 higher switching probabilities from recession to expansion. Our 
 results also imply that a recession and an expansion are, on average, 
 longer or shorter depending on what time of the year they start. Such 
 results suggest the presence of seasonal patterns in business cycle 
 durations. One should note though that such a notion of seasonality is 
 quite different from the common one based on unobserved component 
 linear time series models. Our paper investigates issues which go 
 beyond linear dependence between seasonality and business cycles.

Title: Christmas, Spring and the Dawning of Economic Recovery 
Abstract: Six months of the year, which for convenience we call the 
 spring and Christmas seasons, have a statistically higher number of 
 troughs than the other six months of the year. In contrast, peaks do 
 not exhibit any clustering. These results are drawn from the NBER 
 chronology as well as alternative chronologies. As peaks are evenly 
 distributed and troughs are not, it also appears that contraction 
 lengths following peaks in the off-season are longer which is also an 
 indication of the uneven propensity to switch regime throughout the 
 year. This paper deliberately takes a "model-free" and 
 "distribution-free" approach to test and document these phenomena. 
 Markov chain models, their stochastic process theory and spectral 
 representation appear in Ghysels (1991, 1992). Such models reveal 
 more information and do not even require the use of the NBER 
 chronology; yet, they require a fair number of auxiliary assumptions 
 which are not imposed in the paper.

Title: Approximately Median-Unbiased Estimation of Autoregressive 
 Models with Applications to U.S. Macroeconomic and Financial Time 
 Series 
Abstract: This paper introduces approximately median-unbiased 
 estimators for univariate AR(p) models with time trends. Confidence 
 intervals also are considered. The methods are applied to the 
 Nelson-Plosser macroeconomic data series, the extended Nelson-Plosser 
 macroeconomic data series, and some annual stock dividend and price 
 series. The results show that most of the series exhibit substantially 
 greater persistence than least squares estimates and some Bayesian 
 estimates suggest. For example, for the extended Nelson-Plosser data 
 set, eight of the fourteen series are estimated to have a unit root, 
 while six are estimated to be trend stationary. In contrast, the least 
 squares estimates indicate trend stationarity for all of the series.

Title: Bayes Methods for Trending Multiple Time Series with an 
 Empirical Application to the US Economy 
Abstract: Multiple time series models with stochastic regressors are 
 considered and primary attention is given to vector autoregressions 
 (VAR's) with trending mechanisms that may be stochastic, deterministic 
 or both. In a Bayesian framework, the data density in such a system 
 implies the existence of a time series "Bayes model" and "Bayes 
 measure" of the data. These are predictive models and measures for the 
 next period observation given the historical trajectory to the 
 present. Issues of model selection, hypothesis testing and forecast 
 evaluation are all studied within the context of these models and the 
 measures are used to develop selection criteria, test statistics and 
 encompassing tests within the compass of the same statistical 
 methodology. Of particular interest in applications are lag order and 
 trend degree, causal effects, the presence and number of unit roots in 
 the system, and for integrated series the presence of cointegration 
 and the rank of the cointegration space, which can be interpreted as 
 an order selection problem. In data where there is evidence of mildly 
 explosive behavior we also wish to allow for the presence of co-motion 
 among variables even though they are individually not modelled as 
 integrated series. The paper develops a statistical framework for 
 addressing these features of trending multiple time series and reports 
 an extended empirical application of the methodology to a model of the 
 US economy that sets out to explain the behavior of and to forecast 
 interest rates, unemployment, money stock, prices and income. The 
 performance of a data-based, evolving "Bayes model" of these series is 
 evaluated against some rival fixed format VAR's, VAR's with Minnesota 
 priors (BVARM's) and univariate models. The empirical results show 
 that fixed format VAR's and BVARM's all perform poorly in forecasting 
 exercises in comparison with evolving "Bayes models" that explicitly 
 adapt in form as new data becomes available.

Title: Bayes Models and Forecasts of Australian Macroeconomic Time 
 Series 
Abstract: This paper provides an empirical implementation of some 
 recent work by the author and Werner Ploberger on the development of 
 "Bayes models" for time series. The methods offer a new data-based 
 approach to model selection, to hypothesis testing and to forecast 
 evaluation in the analysis of time series. A particular advantage of 
 the approach is that modelling issues such as lag order, parameter 
 constancy, and the presence of deterministic and stochastic trends all 
 come within the compass of the same statistical methodology, as do the 
 evaluation of forecasts from competing models. The paper shows how to 
 build parsimonious empirical "Bayes models" using the new approach and 
 applies the methodology to some Australian macroeconomic data. "Bayes 
 models" are constructed for 13 quarterly Australian macroeconomic time 
 series over the period 1959(3)-1987(4). These models are compared with 
 certain fixed format models (like an AR(4) + linear trend) in terms of 
 their forecasting performance over the period 1988(1)-1991(4). The 
 "Bayes models" are found to be superior in these forecasting exercises 
 for 10 of the 13 series, while at the same time being more 
 parsimonious in form.

Title: Bayesian Model Selection and Prediction with Empirical Applications 
Abstract: This paper builds on some recent work by the author and 
 Werner Ploberger (1991, 1994) on the development of "Bayes models" for 
 time series and on the authors' model selection criterion "PIC." The 
 PIC criterion is used in this paper to determine the lag order, the 
 trend degree, and the presence or absence of a unit root in an 
 autoregression with deterministic trend. A new forecast encompassing 
 test for Bayes models is developed which allows one Bayes model to be 
 compared with another on the basis of their respective forecasting 
 performance. The paper reports an extended empirical application of 
 the methodology to the Nelson-Plosser (1982)/Schotman-van Dijk (1991) 
 data. It is shown that parsimonious, evolving-format Bayes models 
 forecast-encompass fixed Bayes models of the "AR(3) + linear trend" 
 variety for most of these series. In some cases, the forecast 
 performance of the parsimonious Bayes models is substantially 
 superior. The results cast some doubts on the value of working with 
 fixed format time series models in empirical research and demonstrate 
 the practical advantages of evolving-format models. The paper makes a 
 new suggestion for modelling interest rates in terms of reciprocals of 
 levels rather than levels (which display more volatility) and shows 
 that the best data-determined model for this transformed series is a 
 martingale.

Title: Expectations Driven Nonlinear Business Cycles 
Abstract: The first part of the paper is a brief introduction to the 
 concepts and methods used in recent endogenous business cycles models. 
 Endogenous deterministic and stochastic fluctuations are bound to 
 occur, under increasingly plausible assumptions, in models with 
 individual optimization, market clearing and self-fulfilling 
 expectations when there are capital market imperfections. The 
 phenomenon is most likely to be observed, in a nonlinear framework, 
 when some eigenvalue(s) of the system have a modulus close to 1 (unit 
 roots). It is argued that endogenous business cycles models have 
 become more and more credible alternatives to describe observed 
 fluctuations in our economies.
  
 The second part of the paper reviews recent studies suggesting that 
 self-fulfilling expectations are often dynamically unstable when 
 learning is taken into account. The phenomenon is most likely to occur 
 when expectations matter significantly, which might explain why actual 
 economic time series display higher volatilities in markets for 
 capital investment, inventories, durable goods, financial assets and 
 stocks. It is suggested that on account of the important 
 nonlinearities involved in learning, actual learning dynamics may 
 generate highly complex, even chaotic, trajectories.

Title: Simulation of Multivariate Normal Rectangle Probabilities: 
 Theoretical and Computational Results 
Abstract: An extensive literature in econometrics and in numerical 
 analysis has considered the problem of evaluating the multiple 
 integral P({bold B};mu,Omega) = integral_{a}^{b} n(v - mu, Omega)dv = 
 E_{V}{bold 1}(V in {bold B}), where V is a m-dimensional normal vector 
 with mean mu, covariance matrix , and density n(v - mu Omega)and 
 1(V in {bold B}) is an indicator for the event B = {V | a < V < b}. 
 A leading case of such an integral is the negative orthant 
 probability, where {bold B} = {v | v < 0}. The problem is 
 computationally difficult except in very special cases. 
  
 The multinomial probit (MNP) model used in econometrics and biometrics 
 has cell probabilities that are negative orthant probabilities, with 
 and depending on unknown parameters (and, in general, on covariates). 
 Estimation of this model requires, for each trial parameter vector and 
 each observation in a sample, evaluation of P(mu;{bold B}) and of its 
 derivatives with respect to mu and Omega. This paper surveys Monte 
 Carlo techniques that have been developed for approximations of 
 P(mu;Omega) and its linear and logarithmic derivatives that limit 
 computation while possessing properties that facilitate their use in 
 iterative calculations for statistical inference: the Crude Frequency 
 Simulator (CFS), Normal Importance Sampling (NIS), a Kernel-Smoothed 
 Frequency Simulator (KFS), Stern's Decomposition Simulator (SDS), the 
 Geweke-Hajivassiliou-Keane Simulator (GHK), a Parabolic Cylinder 
 Function Simulator (PCF), Deak's Chi-squared Simulator (DCS), an 
 Acceptance/Rejection Simulator (ARS), the Gibbs Sampler Simulator 
 (GSS), a Sequentially Unbiased Simulator (SUS), and an Approximately 
 Unbiased Simulator (AUS). We also discuss Gauss and FORTRAN 
 implementations of these algorithms and present our computational 
 experience with them. We find that GHK is overall the most  reliable 
 method.

Title: Rolling the 'Dice': An Optimal Transition Path for Controlling 
 Greenhouse Gases 
Abstract: The possibility of greenhouse warming has received growing 
 attention in recent years. Many scientific bodies are calling for 
 severe curbs on the emissions of greenhouse gases. To date, the calls 
 to arms and treaty negotiations have progressed more or less 
 independently of economic studies of the costs and benefits of 
 measures to slow greenhouse warming. The plan of the present study is 
 to develop a dynamic, global model of both the impacts of and policies 
 to slow global warming. It is an integral model that incorporates both 
 the dynamics of emissions and impacts and the economic costs of 
 policies to curb emissions.

Title: A Note on the Dual Approach to the Existence and 
 Characterization of Optimal Consumption Decisions Under Uncertainty 
 and Liquidity Constraints 
Abstract: This paper considers a dual approach to the problem of 
 maximizing lifetime utility subject to liquidity constraints in a 
 discrete time setting. These constraints prohibit the decision maker 
 from borrowing against future endowment income. The dual approach 
 allows us to exploit directly the supermartingale property of the 
 marginal utility of expenditure and to establish existence and 
 uniqueness of the optimal solution. The optimal solution is 
 interpreted as deriving from a version of the problem that is 
 subject to a single lifetime budget constraint, where expenditures and 
 incomes are discounted to the beginning of the horizon by means of 
 individualized Arrow-Debreu prices.

Title: Posterior Odds Testing for a Unit Root with Data-Based Model 
 Selection 
Abstract: The Kalman filter is sued to derive updating equations for 
 the Bayesian data density in discrete time linear regression models 
 with stochastic regressors. The implied "Bayes model" has time varying 
 parameters and conditionally heterogeneous error variances. A 
 sigma-finite "Bayes model" measure is given and used to produce a new 
 model selection criterion (PIC) and objective posterior odds tests for 
 sharp null hypotheses like the presence of a unit root. Simulation 
 results and an empirical application are reported. The simulations 
 show that the new model selection criterion "PIC" works very well and 
 is generally superior to the Schwarz criterion BIC even in stationary 
 systems.

Title: Optimal Tests When a Nuisance Parameter Is Present Only Under 
 the Alternative 
Abstract: This paper derives asymptotically optimal tests for testing 
 problems in which a nuisance parameter exists under the alternative 
 hypothesis but not under the null. The results of the paper are of 
 interest, because the testing problem considered in non-standard and 
 the classical asymptotic optimality results for the Wald, Lagrange 
 multiplier (LM), and likelihood ratio (LR) tests do not apply. In the 
 non-standard cases of main interest, new optimal tests are obtained 
 and the LR test is not found to be an optimal test.

Title: Money (for New Palgrave Money and Finance) 
Abstract: Among the conventions of almost every human society of 
 historical record has been the use of money, i.e., particular 
 commodities or tokens as measures of value and media of exchange in 
 economic transactions. Somehow the members of a society agree on what 
 will be acceptable tender in making payments and settling debts among 
 themselves. General agreement to the convention, not the particular 
 media agreed upon, is the source of money's immense value to the 
 society. In this respect money is similar to language, standard time, 
 or the convention designating the side of the road for passing. This 
 paper reviews the history of various forms of money, the functions 
 of money, and the role of money in economic theory.

Title: Expanding the Scope of Expectations Data Collection: The U.S. 
 and Japanese Stock Markets 
Abstract: A pilot effort was undertaken to experiment with a method of 
 collecting parallel time series data for expectations and popular 
 models and theories of institutional stock market participants in the 
 United States and Japan 1989-91, covering the period before and after 
 the dramatic and sudden halving of Japanese stock prices. Substantial 
 variability within countries through time in the responses and 
 dramatic differences across countries in expectations (even 
 expectations for the same country) were found. There are significant 
 research opportunities in expanded data collection along these lines.

Title: Interpreting the Macroeconomic Time Series Facts: The Effects 
 of Monetary Policy 
Abstract: Existing theory and evidence on the effects of monetary policy 
 are reviewed. Substantial room for disagreement among economists 
 remains. New evidence, based on multivariate time series studies of 
 several countries, is presented. While certain patterns in the data 
 consistent with effective monetary policy are strikingly similar 
 across countries, others, particularly the tendency of interest rate 
 increases to predict high inflation, are harder to reconcile with 
 effective monetary policy.

Title: The Impact of Climate on Agriculture: A Ricardian Approach  
Abstract: Because of the potential for global warming, there are 
 widespread concerns about the impact of changing climate upon the 
 productivity of land in farming and other sectors. This paper develops 
 a new approach for measuring the economic impact of environmental 
 factors such as climate on production by examining the direct impact 
 of the environmental factor on land productivity as measured by land 
 prices. This new method is applied to examine the effect of climate 
 on agriculture using cross-sectional farm data for almost 3000 
 counties in the United States. It finds substantial impacts of 
 climatic variation on both land values and farm revenues. Among the 
 central findings are that higher temperatures in all seasons except 
 autumn reduce all seasons except autumn increases farm values. The 
 relationships are, however, nonlinear and complex.

Title: The 'DICE' Model: Background and Structure of a Dynamic 
 Integrated Climate-Economy Model of the Economics of Global Warming  
Abstract: This study is designed to present the methodological and 
 technical assumptions and the results behind the Dynamic Integrated 
 model of Climate and the Economy (the DICE model). It is a model 
 that attempts to use the tools of modern economics to determine an 
 efficient strategy for coping with the threat of global warming. The 
 fundamental premise behind this study is that societies should 
 undertake environmental policies only when their benefits, broadly 
 construed, exceed their costs and that the level of environmental 
 control should be at that point where the incremental benefits of 
 additional controls no longer exceed the incremental costs. In the 
 area of global warming, this general strategy is easy to articulate 
 and difficult to execute. The work embodied in this study lays out 
 one approach -- the use of dynamic economic optimization -- to the 
 construction of an efficient control strategy.

Title: Empirical Implications of Arbitrage-Free Asset Markets 
Abstract: The martingale-equivalence condition delivered by a 
 non-arbitrage assumption in complete asset markets has implications 
 for fine-time-unit asset price behavior that can be rejected with 
 finite spans of data. A class of stochastic processes that could 
 model such deviations from martingale-equivalence is proposed.

Title: Simulation Estimation Methods for Limited Dependent Variable 
 Models 
Abstract: This chapter discusses simulation estimation methods that 
 overcome the computational intractability of classical estimation of 
 limited dependent variable models with flexible correlation structures 
 in the unobservable stochastic terms. These difficulties arise because 
 of the need to evaluate accurately very high dimensional integrals. 
 The methods based on simulation do not require the exact evaluation 
 of these integrals and hence are feasible using computers of even 
 moderate power. I first discuss a series of ideas that had been used 
 in efforts to circumvent these computational problems by employing 
 standard numerical analysis approximation methods. I then show how 
 simulation techniques solve the computational problems without the 
 need to resort to either generally unsatisfactory numerical 
 approximations. All currently known simulation algorithms are then 
 compared in terms of theoretical properties and practical performance.

Title: Index-Based Futures and Options Markets in Real Estate 
Abstract: Most institutional and individual portfolios are very 
 undiversified in real estate: many hold no real estate at all, many 
 have holdings highly concentrated in certain regions or types of real 
 estate. The risk of these concentrated holdings is not hedged. We 
 propose here that cash-settled futures and options markets be opened 
 on real estate to better allow diversification and hedging, and show 
 that these markets solve problems that have hampered other real estate 
 hedging media in the past. Related institutions, such as home equity 
 insurance, might develop around the futures and options markets. The 
 establishment of these markets is likely to increase the quantity of 
 reproducible real estate, and lower rents on real estate. It may also 
 reduce the amplitude of speculative real estate price movements and 
 dampen the business cycle.

Title: Estimates of the Bias of Lagged Dependent Variable Coefficient 
 Estimates in Macroeconomic Equations 
Abstract: A stochastic-simulation method is proposed in this paper 
 for obtaining median unbiased estimates of lagged dependent variable 
 coefficients in macroeconomic models. Estimated biases for 13 
 equations of a macroeconomic model are computed. These biases are on 
 average somewhat smaller in absolute bias than would be expected from 
 Andrews' exact results for an equation with only a constant term, time 
 trend, and lagged dependent variable, although they are larger than 
 would be expected from Hurwicz's original estimates. In a practical 
 sense the estimated biases are not very large because they have little 
 effect on the overall predictive accuracy of the model and on its 
 multiplier properties.

Title: The Cowles Commission Approach, Real Business Cycle Theories, 
 and New Keynesian Economics 
Abstract: The Cowles Commission approach is reviewed and compared to 
 the approaches of real business cycle (RBC) theorists and new 
 Keynesian economists. It is argued that RBC models are not tested in a 
 serious enough way and that the new Keynesian literature is not 
 empirical enough for testing even to be a serious possibility. 
 Macroeconomics seems to be moving away from its traditional empirical 
 basis, which is sad. This paper argues for returning to the path that 
 was abandoned by most macroeconomists around 1970, namely the 
 specification and testing of structural macroeconometric models.

Title: Unidentified Components in Reduced Rank Regression Estimation 
 of ECM's 
Abstract: Reduced rank regression procedures in error correction models 
 (ECM's) permit consistent estimation of the cointegration space but do 
 not provide consistent estimates of individual structural relations 
 when the dimension of the cointegration space is greater than one. 
 Indeed, individual structural cointegrating equations are unidentified 
 without additional a priori restrictions, just as in the conventional 
 simultaneous equations framework. The effect of this lack of 
 identification is explored by considering the distributions and limit 
 distributions of reduced rank regression estimates of unidentified 
 components of the cointegrating matrix in a typical VAR formulation of 
 the ECM. Some recommendations are made for empirical practice.

Title: A Bayesian Analysis of Trend Determination in Economic Time 
 Series 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a comprehensive Bayesian posterior 
 analysis of trend determination in general autoregressive models. 
 Multiple lag autoregressive models with fitted drifts and time trends 
 as well as models that allow for certain types of structural change 
 in the deterministic components are considered. We utilize a modified 
 information matrix-based prior that accommodates stochastic 
 nonstationarity, takes into account the interactions between long-run 
 and short-run dynamics and controls the degree of stochastic 
 nonstationarity permitted. We derive analytic posterior densities for 
 all of the trend determining parameters via the Laplace approximation 
 to multivariate integrals. We also address the sampling properties of 
 our posteriors under alternative data generating processes by 
 simulation methods. We apply our Bayesian techniques to the 
 Nelson-Plosser macroeconomic data and various stock price and dividend 
 data.

Title: Vector Autoregression and Causality: A Theoretical Overview and 
 Simulation Study 
Abstract: This paper provides a theoretical overview of Wald tests for 
 Granger causality in levels vector autoregressions (VAR's) and 
 Johansen-type error correction models (ECM's) for VAR models the 
 results for inference are not encouraging. The limit theory typically 
 involves nonstandard distributions and nuisance parameters, and there 
 is no sound statistical basis for testing causality in such a 
 framework. Granger causality tests in ECM's also suffer from nuisance 
 parameter dependencies asymptotically and nonstandard limit theory. 
 But, in spite of these difficulties Johansen-type ECM's do offer a 
 sound basis for empirical testing of the rank of the cointegration 
 space and the rank of key submatrices that influence the asymptotics. 
 In consequence, we recommend some operational procedures for 
 conducting Granger causality tests in the important practical case of 
 testing the causal effects of  one variable on another group of 
 variables and vice versa.

Title: The Long-Run Australian Consumption Function Reexamined: An 
 Empirical Exercise in Bayesian Influence 
Abstract: This paper reports an empirical application of new Baynesian 
 methodology to Australian data on consumption, income, liquid assets 
 and inflation. The methods involve the use of objective model based 
 reference priors and objective posterior odds test criteria. The paper 
 provides an overview of this methodology, which is based on recent 
 work by the author (1991) and joint work with Werner Ploberger (1991) 
 and Eric Zivot (1991). The empirical application involves tests of 
 nonstationarity and cointegration in the data and various long-run 
 model specifications are studied in detail. Bayesian empirical results 
 are presented alongside well-known classical tests and are shown to 
 provide especially useful evidence in cases where the classical test 
 results are  mixed. Our empirical results show that real private 
 consumption expenditure and household disposal income are not 
 cointegrated either in real or  nominal terms. Instead we find strong 
 empirical support for the inclusion of an inflation or relative 
 capital loss measure in the Australian consumption function. Suitable 
 measures of these variables are constructed and a final specification 
 is recommended which yields a long-run  cointegrating relation that is 
 empirically compatible in real and nominal terms.
