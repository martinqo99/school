Title: On Fragility of Bubbles in Equilibrium Asset Pricing Models of Lucas-Type.
Abstract: In this paper we study the existence of bubbles for pricing equilibria in a pure exchange economy à la Lucas, with infinitely lived homogeneous agents. The model is analyzed under fairly general assumptions: no restrictions either on the stochastic process governing dividends’ distribution or on the utilities (possibly unbounded) are required. We prove that the pricing equilibrium is unique as long as the agents exhibit uniformly bounded relative risk aversion. A generic uniqueness result is also given regardless of agent’s preferences. A few ”pathological” examples of economies exhibiting pricing equilibria with bubble components are constructed. Finally, a possible relationship between our approach and the theory developed by Santos and Woodford on ambiguous bubbles is investigated. The whole discussion sheds more insight on the common belief that bubbles are a marginal phenomenon in such models.

Title: Probabilistic sophistication and multiple priors.
Abstract: We show that under fairly mild conditions, a maximin expected utility preference relation is probabilistically sophisticated if and only if it is subjective expected utility.

Title: Subcalculus for set functions and cores of TU games.
Abstract: This paper introduces a subcalculus for general set functions and uses this framework to study the core of TU games. After stating a linearity theorem, we establish several theorems that characterize mea- sure games having finite-dimensional cores. This is a very tractable class of games relevant in many economic applications. Finally, we show that exact games with Þnite dimensional cores are generalized linear production games.

Title: Expected utility theory without the completeness axiom.
Abstract: We study axiomatically the problem of obtaining an expected utility representation for a potentially incomplete preference relation over lotteries by means of a set of von Neumann-Morgenstern utility functions. It is shown that, when the prize space is a compact metric space, a preference relation admits such a Multi-utility representation provided that it satisfies the standard axioms of expected utility theory. Moreover, the representing set of utilities in unique in a well-defined sense.

Title: Random correspndences as bundles of random variables.

Title: A subjective spin on roulette wheels.
Abstract: We provide a behavioral foundation to the notion of ‘mixture’ of acts, which is used to great advantage in he decision setting introduced by Anscombe and Aumann. Our construction allows one to formulate mixture-space axioms even in a fully sub-jective setting, without assuming the existence of randomizing devices. This simplifies the task of developing axiomatic models which only use behavioral data. Moreover, it is immune from the difficulty that agents may ‘distort’ the probabilities associated with randomizing devices. For illustration, we present simple subjective axiomatizations of some models of choice under uncertainty, including the maxmin expected utility model of Gilboa and Schmeidler, and Bewley’s model of choice with incomplete preferences.

Title: Optimal two-object auctions with synergies.
Abstract: We design the revenue-maximizing auction for two goods when each buyer has bi-dimensional private information and a superadditive utility function (i.e., a synergy is generated if a buyer wins both goods). In this setting the seller is likely to allocate the goods inefficiently with respect to an environ-ment with no synergies. In particular, if the synergy is large then it may occur that a buyer’s valuations for the goods weakly dominate the valuations of another buyer and the latter one receives the bundle. We link this fact, which contrasts with the results for a setting without synergies, to "non-regular" one-good models.

Title: Risk, ambiguity, and the separation of utility and beliefs.
Abstract: We introduce a general model of static choice under uncertainty, arguably the weakest model achieving a separation of cardinal utility and a unique representation of beliefs. Most of the non-expected utility models existing in the literature are special cases of it. Such separation is motivated by the view that tastes are constant, whereas beliefs change with new information. The model has a simple and natural axiomatization. Elsewhere (forthcoming) we show that it can be very helpful in the characterization of a notion of ambiguity aversion, as separating utility and beliefs allows to identify and remove aspects of risk attitude from the decision maker’s behavior. Here we show that the model allows to generalize several results on the characterization of risk aversion in betting behavior. These generalizations are of independent interest, as they show that some traditional results for subjective expected utility preferences can be formulated only in terms of binary acts.

Title: Change of numéraire for affine arbitrage pricing models driven by multifactor marked point processes.
Abstract: We derive a general formula for the change of numéraire in multifactor ane arbitrage free models driven by marked point processes. As a complement, we present both ane structures and change of measures in the general setting of jump diusions. This provides for a comprehensive view on the subject.

Title: Credit rationing, wealth inequality, and allocation of talent.
Abstract: We provide a simple model of credit rationing with endogenous occupational chioce. Entrepreneurial talent is subject to private information and to screen borrowers banks ask for collateral. The interplay between the labour market and the credit market leads to multiple equilibria in a natural way. The higher is the wage rate, the lower is the collateral needed to discourage less talented agents from borrowing. This allows a greater number of poor but talented agets to become entrepreneurs, thereby increasing labor demand and justifying the wage increase. We discuss the implications of our model for economic policy which are very different from those suggested by models that focus on the credit market only.

Title: BV as a dual space.
Abstract: Let C be a field of subsets of a set I. It is well known that the space FA of all the finitely additive games of bounded variation on C is the norm dual of the space of all simple functions on C. In this paper we prove that the space BV of all the games of bounded variation on C is the norm dual of the space of all simple games on C. This result is equivalent to the compactness of the unit ball in BV with respect to the vague topology.

Title: Yaari dual theory without the completeness axiom.
Abstract: This note shows how Yaari’s dual theory of choice under risk naturally extends to the case of incomplete preferences. This also provides an axiomatic characterization of a large and widely studied class of stochastic orders used to rank the riskiness of random variables or the dispersion of income distributions (including, e.g., second order stochastic dominance, dispersion, location independent riskiness).
