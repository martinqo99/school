Abstract: Repeated interaction between duopolists in a segmented industry is
    considered. The industry is fragmented into two separate segments.
    The duopolists compete in prices and segment choice, assuming that
    pricing strategies are completely flexible while segment choice is
    irreversible.  Initially the two firms are located in different
    segments of the market, but they can choose to extend their operation
    to the other segment, operating in the whole industry.  It is shown
    that there exists an equilibrium involving segment location and
    collusion in prices. The equilibrium path is further restricted by the
    magnitude of the fixed cost of entering the other segment, and by
    refinements on the equilibrium concept. Finally, the implications of
    the irreversibility of the entry decision are analyzed.

Abstract: Abtract:  This paper considers learning in an imperfectly
    competitive
    setting.  By allowing an opponent a ``head start," unsuccessful
    unilateral experimentation may jeopardize future sales and profits.
    We show that even in the absence of spillover and signalling
    effects, competition can inhibit the scope of learning, relative to
    a monopoly.

Title: Hedonic price indexes for spreadsheets and an empirical test of the network externalities hypothesis

Abstract: In this paper, I  first estimate hedonic price equations
    for computer spreadsheet programs, and then use the analysis to
    empirically test whether network externalities exist in this
    industry.  The study shows that consumers are willing to pay a
    significant premium for spreadsheets that are compatible with  the
    Lotus platform and for spreadsheets that offer links to external
    data bases, and a smaller premium for spreadsheets that offer local
    area network compatibility.  These results support the hypothesis
    that the computer spreadsheet market exhibits network
    externalities.  Finally, the quality-adjusted (real) price index of
    computer spreadsheets declined by approximately 15 percent per year
    from 1986-1991.

Abstract: There is a tradition in the literature of transaction-cost
    economics that seeks to explain the existence of firms in
    terms of the inherent superiority of firms as an
    organizational form in some circumstances.  The problem with
    these arguments is that they tend to contrast real firms
    with an idealized -- and extremely narrow -- picture of the
    market.  This paper draws on the evolutionary theory of the
    firm in economics and the resource-based view of the firm in
    strategic management in order to elucidate the concepts of
    firm and market. Its central thesis is that firms do not
    exist because they are inherently superior to markets (that
    is, to markets at their best). Rather, firms exist because
    they are superior to particular markets at particular times
    and places.  The explanation for the existence of firms is
    thus a historically contingent one in many respects.

Abstract: In this paper we address the possibility of horizontal
    foreclosure in markets for complementary services (software) where
    the consumption value of durables (hardware) depends on the
    availability of software.  Horizontal
    foreclosure occurs when a hardware firm merges with a software
    firm and the integrated firm ceases to supply compatible software
    for a rival technology.  We find that horizontal foreclosure can be
    an equilibrium outcome where both the merger and compatibility
    decisions are part of a multistage game which permits the
    foreclosed firm to play a number of counter-strategies.  Moreover,
    foreclosure may result in monopolization of the hardware market.
    We find that the foreclosure equilibrium is inefficient:  total
    surplus would be higher without foreclosure.

Abstract: A general model analyzes the innovator's decision to perform research
    and development directed towards process innovation.  The innovator
    chooses expenditures in several research activities.  The vector of
    research expenditures determines the input-output coefficients that
    describe the innovative technology.  The innovator maximizes rents,
    which with non-drastic innovation equals total savings of variable
    costs, less research expenditures.  If expenditures in different
    activities exhibit diminishing returns in the savings of all factors,
    then the optimization problem has a unique solution. Comparative static
    results are found for changes in factor prices and demand conditions.
    The paper generalizes Binswanger (1974) and Binswanger (1978) to derive
    results with $J$ factors of production and $M$ interdependent research
    activities.
